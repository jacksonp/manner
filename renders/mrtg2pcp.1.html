  <h2>NAME</h2>
  <p><strong>mrtg2pcp</strong> - import MRTG data and create a PCP archive
</section>
<section>
  <h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>
  <p><strong>mrtg2pcp</strong> <em>hostname</em> <em>devname</em> <em>timezone</em> <em>infile</em> <em>outfile</em>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
  <p><strong>mrtg2pcp</strong> is intended to read an MRTG log file as created by <strong>mrtg</strong>(1) and translate this into a Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) archive with the basename <em>outfile</em>. &nbsp;The <em>hostname</em>, <em>devname</em>, and <em>timezone</em> arguments specify information about the system for which the statistics were gathered.
  <p>The resultant PCP achive may be used with all the PCP client tools to graph subsets of the data using <strong>pmchart</strong>(1), perform data reduction and reporting, filter with the PCP inference engine <strong>pmie</strong>(1), etc.
  <p>A series of physical files will be created with the prefix <em>outfile</em>. These are <em>outfile</em><strong>.0</strong> (the performance data), <em>outfile</em><strong>.meta</strong> (the metadata that describes the performance data) and <em>outfile</em><strong>.index</strong> (a temporal index to improve efficiency of replay operations for the archive). &nbsp;If any of these files exists already, then <strong>mrtg2pcp</strong> will <strong>not</strong> overwrite them and will exit with an error message of the form
  <p>__pmLogNewFile: blah.0 already exists, not over-written
  <p><strong>mrtg2pcp</strong> is a Perl script that uses the PCP::LogImport Perl wrapper around the PCP <em>libpcp_import</em> library, and as such could be used as an example to develop new tools to import other types of performance data and create PCP archives.

  <h2>PCP ENVIRONMENT</h2>
  <p>Environment variables with the prefix <strong>PCP_</strong> are used to parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP. On each installation, the file <em>/etc/pcp.conf</em> contains the local values for these variables. The <strong>$PCP_CONF</strong> variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration file, as described in <strong>pcp.conf</strong>(5).
