  <h2>NAME</h2>
  <p>oldfind - search for files in a directory hierarchy
</div>
<div class="section">
  <h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>
  <p><strong>oldfind</strong> [-H] [-L] [-P] [-D debugopts] [-Olevel] [path...] [expression]
</div>

  <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
  <p>The <strong>oldfind</strong> and <strong>find</strong> programs are functionally identical. The only difference between them is the implementation internals of how the filesystem is searched. The <strong>oldfind</strong> binary has a recursive implementation while <strong>find</strong> uses <strong>fts</strong>(3). The fts-based implementation will replace the recursive implementation but for the moment both implementations are installed.
  <p>The implementation which is installed as <strong>find</strong> on this system is the fts-based implementation, since the <strong>--without-fts</strong> option was not passed to the <strong>configure</strong> script when findutils was built.
