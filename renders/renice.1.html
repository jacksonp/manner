<h1>RENICE</h1>
<div class="section">
  <h2>NAME</h2>
  <p>renice - alter priority of running processes
</div>
<div class="section">
  <h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>
  <p><strong>renice</strong> [<strong>-n</strong>] <em>priority</em> [<strong>-g</strong>|<strong>-p</strong>|<strong>-u</strong>] <em>identifier</em>...
</div>
<div class="section">
  <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
  <p><strong>renice</strong> alters the scheduling priority of one or more running processes. The first argument is the <em>priority</em> value to be used. The other arguments are interpreted as process IDs (by default), process group IDs, user IDs, or user names. <strong>renice</strong>'ing a process group causes all processes in the process group to have their scheduling priority altered. <strong>renice</strong>'ing a user causes all processes owned by the user to have their scheduling priority altered.
</div>
<div class="section">
  <h2>OPTIONS</h2>
  <dl>
    <dt><strong>-n</strong>, <strong>--priority</strong> <em>priority</em>
    <dd>Specify the scheduling <em>priority</em> to be used for the process, process group, or user. Use of the option <strong>-n</strong> or <strong>--priority</strong> is optional, but when used it must be the first argument.
    <dt><strong>-g</strong>, <strong>--pgrp</strong>
    <dd>Interpret the succeeding arguments as process group IDs.
    <dt><strong>-p</strong>, <strong>--pid</strong>
    <dd>Interpret the succeeding arguments as process IDs (the default).
    <dt><strong>-u</strong>, <strong>--user</strong>
    <dd>Interpret the succeeding arguments as usernames or UIDs.
    <dt><strong>-V</strong>, <strong>--version</strong>
    <dd>Display version information and exit.
    <dt><strong>-h</strong>, <strong>--help</strong>
    <dd>Display help text and exit.
  </dl>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <h2>EXAMPLES</h2>
  <p>The following command would change the priority of the processes with PIDs 987 and 32, plus all processes owned by the users daemon and root:
  <dl>
    <dt><strong>renice +1 987 -u daemon root -p 32</strong>
  </dl>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <h2>NOTES</h2>
  <p>Users other than the superuser may only alter the priority of processes they own, and can only monotonically increase their “nice value” (for security reasons) within the range 0 to 19, unless a nice resource limit is set (Linux 2.6.12 and higher). The superuser may alter the priority of any process and set the priority to any value in the range -20 to 19. Useful priorities are: 19 (the affected processes will run only when nothing else in the system wants to), 0 (the “base” scheduling priority), anything negative (to make things go very fast).

  <h2>FILES</h2>
  <dl>
    <dt><strong>/etc/passwd</strong>
    <dd>to map user names to user IDs
  </dl>

  <h2>SEE ALSO</h2>
  <p><strong>nice</strong>(1), <strong>getpriority</strong>(2), <strong>setpriority</strong>(2)

<div class="section">
  <h2>BUGS</h2>
  <p>Non-superusers cannot increase scheduling priorities of their own processes, even if they were the ones that decreased the priorities in the first place.
  <p>The Linux kernel (at least version 2.0.0) and linux libc (at least version 5.2.18) does not agree entirely on what the specifics of the systemcall interface to set nice values is. Thus causes renice to report bogus previous nice values.
