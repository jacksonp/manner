<h1>CAL</h1>
<section>
  <h2>NAME</h2>
  <p>cal - display a calendar
</section>
<section>
  <h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>
  <p><strong>cal</strong> [options] [[[<em>day</em>] <em>month</em>] <em>year</em>]<br>
  <strong>cal</strong> [options] &lt;timestamp&gt;
</section>
<section>
  <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
  <p><strong>cal</strong> displays a simple calendar. If no arguments are specified, the current month is displayed.<br>
  <br>
  The <em>month</em> may be specified as a number (1-12) or as a month name according to the current locales.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>cal</strong> accepts special placeholders when parsing <em>timestamp</em>, "now" may be used to refer to the current time, "today", "yesterday", "tomorrow" refer to of the current day, the day before or the next day, respectively.<br>
  <br>
  The relative date specifications are also accepted, in this case "+" is evaluated to the current time plus the specified time span. Correspondingly, a time span that is prefixed with "-" is evaluated to the current time minus the specified time span, for example '+2days'. Instead of prefixing the time span with "+" or "-", it may also be suffixed with a space and the word "left" or "ago" (for example '1 week ago').

  <h2>PARAMETERS</h2>
  <p>A single parameter specifies the year to be displayed; note the year must be fully specified: <strong>cal 89</strong> will not display a calendar for 1989.
  <p>Two parameters denote the month (1 - 12) and year.
  <p>Three parameters denote the day (1-31), month and year, and the day will be highlighted if the calendar is displayed on a terminal. If no parameters are specified, the current month's calendar is displayed.
  <p>A year starts on January 1. The first day of the week is determined by the locale.
  <p>The week numbering depends on the choice of the first day of the week. If Sunday (the default) is used for the first day of the week, then the customary North American numbering will be used, i.e. the first Sunday of the year starts the first week. If Monday is selected, then the ISO-8601 standard week numbering is used, where the first Thursday of the year is in week number 1.

  <h2>COLORS</h2>

  <h2>BUGS</h2>
  <p>The <strong>cal</strong> program uses the 3rd of September 1752 as the date of the Gregorian calendar reformation -- that is when it happened in Great Britain and its colonies (including what is now the USA). Starting at that date, eleven days were eliminated by this reformation, so the calendar for that month is rather unusual. The actual historical dates at which the calendar reform happened in all the different countries (locales) are ignored.
  <p>Alternative calendars, such as the Umm al-Qura, the Solar Hijri, the Ge'ez, or the lunisolar Hindu, are not supported.
