<h1>TAILF</h1>
<div class="section">
  <h2>NAME</h2>
  <p>tailf - follow the growth of a log file
</div>
<div class="section">
  <h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>
  <p><strong>tailf</strong> [option] <em>file</em>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
  <p><strong>tailf is deprecated.</strong> It may have unfixed bugs and will be removed from util-linux in March 2017. Nowadays it's safe to use <strong>tail -f</strong> (from coreutils), in contrast to what the original documentation below says.
  <p><strong>tailf</strong> will print out the last 10 lines of the given <em>file</em> and then wait for this <em>file</em> to grow. It is similar to <strong>tail -f</strong> but does not access the file when it is not growing. This has the side effect of not updating the access time for the file, so a filesystem flush does not occur periodically when no log activity is happening.
  <p><strong>tailf</strong> is extremely useful for monitoring log files on a laptop when logging is infrequent and the user wishes the hard disk to spin down to conserve battery life.
