<h1>NAMEI</h1>
<section>
  <h2>NAME</h2>
  <p>namei - follow a pathname until a terminal point is found
</section>
<section>
  <h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>
  <p><strong>namei</strong> [options] <em>pathname</em>...
</section>
<section>
  <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
  <p><strong>namei</strong> interprets its arguments as pathnames to any type of Unix file (symlinks, files, directories, and so forth). <strong>namei</strong> then follows each pathname until an endpoint is found (a file, a directory, a device node, etc). If it finds a symbolic link, it shows the link, and starts following it, indenting the output to show the context.
  <p>This program is useful for finding "too many levels of symbolic links" problems.
  <p>For each line of output, <strong>namei</strong> uses the following characters to identify the file type found:
  <pre>   f: = the pathname currently being resolved
    d = directory
    l = symbolic link (both the link and its contents are output)
    s = socket
    b = block device
    c = character device
    p = FIFO (named pipe)
    - = regular file
    ? = an error of some kind</pre>
  <p><strong>namei</strong> prints an informative message when the maximum number of symbolic links this system can have has been exceeded.
