  <h2>NAME</h2>
  <p><strong>pmdapipe</strong> - command output capture performance metrics domain agent (PMDA)

  <h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>
  <p><strong>$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/pipe/pmdapipe</strong> [<strong>-c</strong> <em>configfile</em>] [<strong>-d</strong> <em>domain</em>] [<strong>-l</strong> <em>logfile</em>] [<strong>-m</strong> <em>memory</em>]

  <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
  <p><strong>pmdapipe</strong> is a configurable command output monitoring Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA). It can be seen as analogous to a restricted shell, where options can be passed to preset commands, and each line of their output is converted into a performance event. These events can be consumed by client tools like <strong>pmval</strong>(1).
  <p>The <strong>pipe</strong> PMDA exports both event-style metrics reflecting timestamped event records for text-oriented command output, as well as the more orthodox sample-style metrics such as event counts and throughput size values.
  <p>The PMDA is configured via a <em>configfile</em> which contains one line for each process from which output can be captured, as described in the ``CONFIGURATION'' section below.
  <p>A brief description of the <strong>pmdapipe</strong> command line options follows:
  <dl>
    <dt><strong>-c</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>specifies an alternate configuration file for the PMDA. By default, a file named <em>$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/pipe/pipe.conf</em> and any files below the <em>$PCP_SYSCONF_DIR/pipe.conf.d/</em> directory are used.
    <dt><strong>-d</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics <em>domain</em> number specified here is unique and consistent. That is, <em>domain</em> should be different for every PMDA on the one host, and the same <em>domain</em> number should be used for the same PMDA on all hosts.
    <dt><strong>-l</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Location of the log file. &nbsp;By default, a log file named <em>pipe.log</em> is written in the current directory of <strong>pmcd</strong>(1) when <strong>pmdapipe</strong> is started, i.e. <strong>$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd</strong>. If the log file cannot be created or is not writable, output is written to the standard error instead.
    <dt><strong>-m</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Limit the physical memory used by the PMDA to buffer event records to <em>maxsize</em> bytes. As log events arrive at the PMDA, they must be buffered until individual client tools request the next batch since their previous batch of events. The default maximum is 2 megabytes.
  </dl>

  <h2>CONFIGURATION</h2>
  <p>The set of allowed pipe commands is configured by simple text file(s). The format is a single line for each command followed by an optional access control section.
  <p>Blank lines and comments are permitted (even encouraged) in the configuration file. A comment begins with a ``#'' character and finishes at the end of the line.
  <p>Each command configuration line is of the form:
  <p class="indent-7"><em>instance</em> <em>username</em> <em>command</em> <em>options</em>
  <p>Where,
  <dl>
    <dt><em>instance</em>
    <dd>
      <p>is a string identifying the pipe command, also exported as the metric instance identifier.
    <dt><em>username</em>
    <dd>
      <p>is the name of the user account under which the command should run (e.g. "root")
    <dt><em>command</em>
    <dd>
      <p>is the path to the binary which will be run to generate piped output
    <dt><em>options</em>
    <dd>
      <p>is an optional space-separated list of parameters to pass to the <em>command</em>
      <p>This <em>options</em> list may contain numeric parameters prefixed by the dollar-sign, and these will be substituted with user-supplied values at the time the <em>command</em> is run (similar to shell parameter substitution).
  </dl>
  <p>Parameters are passed as a single space-separated or comma-separated string to the <em>pipe.firehose</em> metric, using the <strong>pmStore (3)</strong> interface. The <strong>pmval</strong> command provides store access via its <strong>-x</strong> option. User-supplied parameters are restricted to containing alphanumeric characters.
  <p>The access control section of the file must start with a line of the form:
  <p><strong>[access]</strong>
  <p>Leading and trailing whitespace may appear around and within the brackets and the case of the <strong>access</strong> keyword is ignored. No other text may appear on the line except a trailing comment.
  <p>Following this line, the remainder of the configuration file should contain lines that allow or disallow use of <em>commands</em> from particular users or groups.
  <p>User names and group names will be verified using the local <strong>/etc/passwd</strong> and <strong>/etc/groups</strong> files (or an alternative directory service), using the <strong>getpwent</strong>(3) and <strong>getgrent</strong>(3) routines.
  <p>Access for users or groups are allowed or disallowed by specifying statements of the form:
  <p class="indent-7"><strong>allow user</strong> <em>username</em> <strong>:</strong> <em>instance</em><br>
  <strong>disallow user</strong> <em>username</em> <strong>:</strong> <em>instance</em><br>
  <strong>allow group</strong> <em>groupname</em> <strong>:</strong> <em>instance</em><br>
  <strong>disallow group</strong> <em>groupname</em> <strong>:</strong> <em>instance</em>
  <p>The <em>username</em> and <em>groupname</em> names will be verified using the local <strong>/etc/passwd</strong> and <strong>/etc/groups</strong> files (or an alternative directory service), using the <strong>getpwent</strong>(3) and <strong>getgrent</strong>(3) routines.
  <p>The wildcard ``*'' can be used to refer to all <em>instance</em> names.

  <h2>INSTALLATION</h2>
  <p>If you want access to the names, help text and values for the pipe performance metrics, do the following as root:
  <pre><code># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/pipe</code>
<code># ./Install</code></pre>
  <p>This is an interactive installation process which prompts for each log file path to be monitored (or command to be run), a metric instance name to identify it, and whether access should be restricted (refer to the <strong>-x</strong> option to <strong>pmval</strong>(1) for further details).
  <p>If you want to undo the installation, do the following as root:
  <pre><code># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/pipe</code>
<code># ./Remove</code></pre>
  <p><strong>pmdapipe</strong> is launched by <strong>pmcd</strong> and should never be executed directly. The Install and Remove scripts notify <strong>pmcd</strong> when the agent is installed or removed.

  <h2>EXAMPLES</h2>
  <p>Following is a simple example of <strong>pmdapipe</strong> configuration and use of the pipe metrics to run the <strong>btrace</strong> command, by user <strong>bob</strong>:
  <pre><code>bob&gt; cat $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/pipe/pipe.conf</code>
<code># instance      user      command</code>
<code>rw_syscalls     root      perf script rw-by-file $1</code>
<code>bdev_trace      root      btrace -w $1 /dev/$2</code>

<code>[access]</code>
<code>allow user bob : *;</code>
<code>allow user jane : bdev_trace;</code>
<code>allow group perf : rw_syscalls;</code>

<code>bob&gt; pmval -i bdev_trace -x '5 sda' pipe.firehose</code>
<code> 8,2  5  1  0.000000000 25227  A  WS 734332384 + 24 &lt;- (253,2) 734330336</code>
<code> 8,0  5  2  0.000000414 25227  A  WS 735358432 + 24 &lt;- (8,2) 734332384</code>
<code> 8,0  5  3  0.000000756 25227  Q  WS 735358432 + 24 [qemu-kvm]</code>
<code> [...5 seconds worth]</code>
<code>bob&gt;</code></pre>

  <h2>PCP ENVIRONMENT</h2>
  <p>Environment variables with the prefix <strong>PCP_</strong> are used to parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP. On each installation, the file <em>/etc/pcp.conf</em> contains the local values for these variables. The <strong>$PCP_CONF</strong> variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration file, as described in <strong>pcp.conf</strong>(5).
