  <h2>NAME</h2>
  <p>macpack - Macintosh OS X Packager for managed gui assemblies
</section>
<section>
  <h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>
  <p><strong>macpack [options] assembly</strong>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
  <p><em>macpack</em> is a tool used to package managed assemblies (like System.Windows.Forms or Cocoa#) that require gui availability for deployment on Mac OS X.
  <p>macpack will prepare a OS X compatible bundle from the provided assembly &nbsp;and resources. &nbsp;The bundle will include the specified assembly as well as any of the provided resources (specified with the -resource: switch).
  <p>Developers can specify the kind of application to produce using the -mode: argument. &nbsp;This controls how the environment in the Mono class libraries is setup.

  <h2>OPTIONS</h2>
  <p><em>-a assembly</em>
  <p>This option tells macpack where the managed assembly that you want to bundle resides. &nbsp;This option is also used to point to the shell script to launch in the case of a X11/Gtk# application.
  <p>This is the same as just passing the assembly as an argument.
  <p><em>-m [winforms,x11,console,cocoa]</em> or <em>-mode:[winforms,x11,console,cocoa]</em>
  <p>A value indicating the kind of application: WinForms is a Winforms application running on Quartz; &nbsp;X11 is an application that requires the X11 server to run; &nbsp;console is a non-graphical application; &nbsp;cocoa is an application based on Cocoa#
  <p><em>-n NAME</em> or <em>-appname:NAME</em>
  <p>This option specifies the application name of the emitted bundle. This is what you will see in Finder.
  <p><em>-o DIRECTORY</em> or <em>-output:DIRECTORY</em>
  <p>This option specifies the path to output the generated Application.
  <p><em>-r RESOURCE</em> or <em>-resource:RESOURCE</em>
  <p>This option can be specified multiple times. &nbsp;It will place a copy of each resource into the bundles resources directory. &nbsp;Alternatively, you can use a comma separated list of resources.
