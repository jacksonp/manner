  <h2>NAME</h2>
  <p>dpkg-trigger - a package trigger utility
</div>
<div class="section">
  <h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>
  <p><strong>dpkg-trigger</strong> [<em>option</em>...] <em>trigger-name</em><br>
  <strong>dpkg-trigger</strong> [<em>option</em>...] <em>command</em>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
  <p><strong>dpkg-trigger</strong> is a tool to explicitly activate triggers and check for its support on the running <strong>dpkg</strong>.
  <p>This can be used by maintainer scripts in complex and conditional situations where the file triggers, or the declarative <strong>activate</strong> triggers control file directive, are insufficiently rich. It can also be used for testing and by system administrators (but note that the triggers won't actually be run by <strong>dpkg-trigger</strong>).
  <p>Unrecognized trigger name syntaxes are an error for <strong>dpkg-trigger</strong>.

  <h2>COMMANDS</h2>
  <dl>
    <dt><strong>--check-supported</strong>
    <dd>Check if the running <strong>dpkg</strong> supports triggers (usually called from a postinst). Will exit <strong>0</strong> if a triggers-capable <strong>dpkg</strong> has run, or <strong>1</strong> with an error message to stderr if not. Normally, however, it is better just to activate the desired trigger with <strong>dpkg-trigger</strong>.
    <dt><strong>-?</strong>, <strong>--help</strong>
    <dd>Show the usage message and exit.
    <dt><strong>--version</strong>
    <dd>Show the version and exit.
  </dl>
</div>

  <h2>OPTIONS</h2>
  <dl>
    <dt><strong>--admindir=</strong><em>dir</em>
    <dd>Change the location of the <strong>dpkg</strong> database. The default location is <em>/var/lib/dpkg</em>.
    <dt><strong>--by-package=<em>package</em></strong>
    <dd>Override trigger awaiter (normally set by <strong>dpkg</strong> through the <strong>DPKG_MAINTSCRIPT_PACKAGE</strong> environment variable of the maintainer scripts, naming the package to which the script belongs, and this will be used by default).
    <dt><strong>--no-await</strong>
    <dd>This option arranges that the calling package T (if any) need not await the processing of this trigger; the interested package(s) I, will not be added to T's trigger processing awaited list and T's status is unchanged. T may be considered installed even though I may not yet have processed the trigger.
    <dt><strong>--await</strong>
    <dd>This option does the inverse of <strong>--no-await</strong> (since dpkg 1.17.21). It is currently the default behavior.
    <dt><strong>--no-act</strong>
    <dd>Just test, do not actually change anything.
  </dl>

<div class="section">
  <h2>EXIT STATUS</h2>
  <dl>
    <dt><strong>0</strong>
    <dd>The requested action was successfully performed. Or a check or assertion command returned true.
    <dt><strong>1</strong>
    <dd>A check or assertion command returned false.
    <dt><strong>2</strong>
    <dd>Fatal or unrecoverable error due to invalid command-line usage, or interactions with the system, such as accesses to the database, memory allocations, etc.
  </dl>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <h2>ENVIRONMENT</h2>
  <dl>
    <dt><strong>DPKG_ADMINDIR</strong>
    <dd>If set and the <strong>--admindir</strong> option has not been specified, it will be used as the <strong>dpkg</strong> data directory.
  </dl>
