<h1>W</h1>
<section>
  <h2>NAME</h2>
  <p>w - Show who is logged on and what they are doing.
</section>
<section>
  <h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>
  <p><strong>w -</strong> [<strong>husfV</strong>] [<em>user</em>]
</section>
<section>
  <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
  <p><strong>w</strong> displays information about the users currently on the machine, and their processes. The header shows, in this order, &nbsp;the current time, how long the system has been running, how many users are currently logged on, and the system load averages for the past 1, 5, and 15 minutes.<br>
  <br>
  The following entries are displayed for each user: login name, the tty name, the remote host, login time, idle time, JCPU, PCPU, and the command line of their current process.<br>
  <br>
  The JCPU time is the time used by all processes attached to the tty. &nbsp;It does not include past background jobs, but does include currently running background jobs.<br>
  <br>
  The PCPU time is the time used by the current process, named in the "what" field.
