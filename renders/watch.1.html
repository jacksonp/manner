<title>WATCH</title>
<h1>WATCH</h1>
<section>
  <h2>NAME</h2>
  <p>watch - execute a program periodically, showing output fullscreen
</section>
<section>
  <h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>
  <p><strong>watch</strong> <em>[-dhvt] [-n &lt;seconds&gt;] [--differences[=cumulative]] [--help] [--interval=&lt;seconds&gt;] [--no-title] [--version] &lt;command&gt;</em>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
  <p><strong>watch</strong> runs <em>command</em> repeatedly, displaying its output (the first screenfull). &nbsp;This allows you to watch the program output change over time. &nbsp;By default, the program is run every 2 seconds; use <em>-n</em> or <em>--interval</em> to specify a different interval.
  <p>The <em>-d</em> or <em>--differences</em> flag will highlight the differences between successive updates. &nbsp;The <em>--cumulative</em> option makes highlighting "sticky", presenting a running display of all positions that have ever changed. &nbsp;The <em>-t</em> or <em>--no-title</em> option turns off the header showing the interval, command, and current time at the top of the display, as well as the following blank line.
  <p><strong>watch</strong> will run until interrupted.

  <h2>NOTE</h2>
  <p>Note that <em>command</em> is given to "sh -c" which means that you may need to use extra quoting to get the desired effect.
  <p>Note that POSIX option processing is used (i.e., option processing stops at the first non-option argument). &nbsp;This means that flags after <em>command</em> don't get interpreted by <strong>watch</strong> itself.

  <h2>EXAMPLES</h2>
  <p>To watch for mail, you might do
  <p class="indent">watch -n 60 from
  <p>To watch the contents of a directory change, you could use
  <p class="indent">watch -d ls -l
  <p>If you're only interested in files owned by user joe, you might use
  <p class="indent">watch -d 'ls -l | fgrep joe'
  <p>To see the effects of quoting, try these out
  <p class="indent">watch echo $$
  <p class="indent">watch echo '$$'
  <p class="indent">watch echo "'"'$$'"'"
  <p>You can watch for your administrator to install the latest kernel with
  <p class="indent">watch uname -r
  <p>(Just kidding.)

  <h2>BUGS</h2>
  <p>Upon terminal resize, the screen will not be correctly repainted until the next scheduled update. &nbsp;All <em>--differences</em> highlighting is lost on that update as well.
  <p>Non-printing characters are stripped from program output. &nbsp;Use "cat -v" as part of the command pipeline if you want to see them.

  <h2>AUTHORS</h2>
  <p>The original <strong>watch</strong> was written by Tony Rems &lt;rembo@unisoft.com&gt; in 1991, with mods and corrections by Francois Pinard. &nbsp;It was reworked and new features added by Mike Coleman &lt;mkc@acm.org&gt; in 1999.
