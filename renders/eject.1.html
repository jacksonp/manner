<title>EJECT</title>
<h1>EJECT</h1>
<section>
  <h2>NAME</h2>
  <p>eject - eject removable media
</section>
<section>
  <h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>
  <p><strong>eject</strong> [options] <em>device</em>|<em>mountpoint</em>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
  <p><strong>eject</strong> allows removable media (typically a CD-ROM, floppy disk, tape, JAZ, ZIP or USB disk) to be ejected under software control. &nbsp;The command can also control some multi-disc CD-ROM changers, the auto-eject feature supported by some devices, and close the disc tray of some CD-ROM drives.
  <p>The device corresponding to <em>device</em> or <em>mountpoint</em> is ejected. &nbsp;If no name is specified, the default name <strong>/dev/cdrom</strong> is used. &nbsp;The device may be addressed by device name (e.g. 'sda'), device path (e.g. '/dev/sda'), UUID=<em>uuid</em> or LABEL=<em>label</em> tags.
  <p>There are four different methods of ejecting, depending on whether the device is a CD-ROM, SCSI device, removable floppy, or tape. &nbsp;By default <strong>eject</strong> tries all four methods in order until it succeeds.
  <p>If a device partition is specified, the whole-disk device is used. &nbsp;If the device or a device partition is currently mounted, it is unmounted before ejecting.

  <h2>OPTIONS</h2>
  <dl>
    <dt><strong>-a</strong>, <strong>--auto on</strong>|<strong>off</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>This option controls the auto-eject mode, supported by some devices. &nbsp;When enabled, the drive automatically ejects when the device is closed.
    <dt><strong>-c</strong>, <strong>--changerslot</strong> <em>slot</em>
    <dd>
      <p>With this option a CD slot can be selected from an ATAPI/IDE CD-ROM changer. Linux 2.0 or higher is required to use this feature. &nbsp;The CD-ROM drive cannot be in use (mounted data CD or playing a music CD) for a change request to work. Please also note that the first slot of the changer is referred to as 0, not 1.
    <dt><strong>-d</strong>, <strong>--default</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>List the default device name.
    <dt><strong>-F</strong>, <strong>--force</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Force eject, don't check device type.
    <dt><strong>-f</strong>, <strong>--floppy</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>This option specifies that the drive should be ejected using a removable floppy disk eject command.
    <dt><strong>-h</strong>, <strong>--help</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Display help text and exit.
    <dt><strong>-i</strong>, <strong>--manualeject on</strong>|<strong>off</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>This option controls locking of the hardware eject button. &nbsp;When enabled, the drive will not be ejected when the button is pressed. &nbsp;This is useful when you are carrying a laptop in a bag or case and don't want it to eject if the button is inadvertently pressed.
    <dt><strong>-M</strong>, <strong>--no-partitions-unmount</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>The option tells eject to not try to unmount other partitions on partitioned devices. &nbsp;If another partition is still mounted, the program will not attempt to eject the media. &nbsp;It will attempt to unmount only the device or mountpoint given on the command line.
    <dt><strong>-m</strong>, <strong>--no-unmount</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>The option tells eject to not try to unmount at all.
    <dt><strong>-n</strong>, <strong>--noop</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>With this option the selected device is displayed but no action is performed.
    <dt><strong>-p</strong>, <strong>--proc</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>This option allows you to use /proc/mounts instead /etc/mtab. &nbsp;It also passes the <strong>-n</strong> option to <strong>umount</strong>(8).
    <dt><strong>-q</strong>, <strong>--tape</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>This option specifies that the drive should be ejected using a tape drive offline command.
    <dt><strong>-r</strong>, <strong>--cdrom</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>This option specifies that the drive should be ejected using a CDROM eject command.
    <dt><strong>-s</strong>, <strong>--scsi</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>This option specifies that the drive should be ejected using SCSI commands.
    <dt><strong>-T</strong>, <strong>--traytoggle</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>With this option the drive is given a CD-ROM tray close command if it's opened, and a CD-ROM tray eject command if it's closed. &nbsp;Not all devices support this command, because it uses the above CD-ROM tray close command.
    <dt><strong>-t</strong>, <strong>--trayclose</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>With this option the drive is given a CD-ROM tray close command. &nbsp;Not all devices support this command.
    <dt><strong>-V</strong>, <strong>--version</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Display version information and exit.
    <dt><strong>-v</strong>, <strong>--verbose</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Run in verbose mode; more information is displayed about what the command is doing.
    <dt><strong>-X</strong>, <strong>--listspeed</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>With this option the CD-ROM drive will be probed to detect the available speeds. &nbsp;The output is a list of speeds which can be used as an argument of the <strong>-x</strong> option. &nbsp;This only works with Linux 2.6.13 or higher, on previous versions solely the maximum speed will be reported. &nbsp;Also note that some drives may not correctly report the speed and therefore this option does not work with them.
    <dt><strong>-x</strong>, <strong>--cdspeed</strong> <em>speed</em>
    <dd>
      <p>With this option the drive is given a CD-ROM select speed command. &nbsp;The <em>speed</em> argument is a number indicating the desired speed (e.g. 8 for 8X speed), or 0 for maximum data rate. &nbsp;Not all devices support this command and you can only specify speeds that the drive is capable of. &nbsp;Every time the media is changed this option is cleared. &nbsp;This option can be used alone, or with the <strong>-t</strong> and <strong>-c</strong> options.

  <h2>EXIT STATUS</h2>
  <p>Returns 0 if operation was successful, 1 if operation failed or command syntax was not valid.

  <h2>NOTES</h2>
  <p><strong>eject</strong> only works with devices that support one or more of the four methods of ejecting. &nbsp;This includes most CD-ROM drives (IDE, SCSI, and proprietary), some SCSI tape drives, JAZ drives, ZIP drives (parallel port, SCSI, and IDE versions), and LS120 removable floppies. &nbsp;Users have also reported success with floppy drives on Sun SPARC and Apple Macintosh systems. &nbsp;If <strong>eject</strong> does not work, it is most likely a limitation of the kernel driver for the device and not the <strong>eject</strong> program itself.
  <p>The <strong>-r</strong>, <strong>-s</strong>, <strong>-f</strong>, and <strong>-q</strong> options allow controlling which methods are used to eject. &nbsp;More than one method can be specified. &nbsp;If none of these options are specified, it tries all four (this works fine in most cases).
  <p><strong>eject</strong> may not always be able to determine if the device is mounted (e.g. if it has several names). &nbsp;If the device name is a symbolic link, <strong>eject</strong> will follow the link and use the device that it points to.
  <p>If <strong>eject</strong> determines that the device can have multiple partitions, it will attempt to unmount all mounted partitions of the device before ejecting (see also <strong>--no-partitions-unmount</strong>). &nbsp;If an unmount fails, the program will not attempt to eject the media.
  <p>You can eject an audio CD. &nbsp;Some CD-ROM drives will refuse to open the tray if the drive is empty. &nbsp;Some devices do not support the tray close command.
  <p>If the auto-eject feature is enabled, then the drive will always be ejected after running this command. &nbsp;Not all Linux kernel CD-ROM drivers support the auto-eject mode. &nbsp;There is no way to find out the state of the auto-eject mode.
  <p>You need appropriate privileges to access the device files. &nbsp;Running as root is required to eject some devices (e.g. SCSI devices).
