  <dl class="indent-8">

    <dd>
      <p>sheet break string. This string (by default - formfeed) would be output at the end of each workbook page. This string is printed after page starting at start of line, but no linefeed would be automatically added at the end of string. Include newline at the ent of sheet separator if you want it to appear on separate line by itself
    <dt><strong>-g</strong><em>number</em>
    <dd>
      <p>number of decimal digits in the numbers. By default maximal double precision (system-dependent macro DBL_DIG) is used.
