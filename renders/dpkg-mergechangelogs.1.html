<h1>dpkg-mergechangelogs</h1>
<p>dpkg-mergechangelogs - 3-way merge of debian/changelog files
<div class="section">
  <h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>
  <p><strong>dpkg-mergechangelogs</strong> [<em>option</em>...] <em>old</em> <em>new-a</em> <em>new-b</em> [<em>out</em>]
</div>
<div class="section">
  <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
  <p>This program will use the 3 provided versions of the Debian changelog to generate a merged changelog file. The resulting changelog is stored in the file <em>out</em> or output to the standard output if that parameter is not given.
  <p>Each entry is identified by its version number and they are assumed to be not conflicting, they are simply merged in the right order (by decreasing version number). When <strong>--merge-prereleases</strong> is used, the part of the version number after the last tilde is dropped so that 1.0-1~exp1 and 1.0-1~exp5 are considered to be the same entry. When the same version is available in both <em>new-a</em> and <em>new-b</em>, a standard line-based 3-way merge is attempted (provided that the module Algorithm::Merge is available — it's part of the package libalgorithm-merge-perl — otherwise you get a global conflict on the content of the entry).
</div>
<div class="section">
  <h2>OPTIONS</h2>
  <dl>
    <dt><strong>-m</strong>, <strong>--merge-prereleases</strong>
    <dd>Drop the part after the last tilde in the version number when doing version comparison to identify if two entries are supposed to be the same or not.<br>
    <br>
    This is useful when you keep using the same changelog entry but you increase its version number regularly. For instance, you might have 2.3-1~exp1, 2.3-1~exp2, ... until the official release 2.3-1 and they are all the same changelog entry that has evolved over time.
    <dt><strong>--help</strong>
    <dd>Show the usage message and exit.
    <dt><strong>--version</strong>
    <dd>Show the version and exit.
  </dl>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <h2>LIMITATIONS</h2>
  <p>Anything that is not parsed by Dpkg::Changelog is lost during the merge. This might include stuff like vim modelines, comments which were not supposed to be there, etc.

  <h2>INTEGRATION WITH GIT</h2>
  <p>If you want to use this program to merge Debian changelog files in a git repository, you have first to register a new merge driver in <strong>.git/config</strong> or <strong>~/.gitconfig</strong>:
  <p>[merge "dpkg-mergechangelogs"] name = debian/changelog merge driver driver = dpkg-mergechangelogs -m %O %A %B %A
  <p>Then you have to setup the merge attribute for the debian/changelog file either in <strong>.gitattributes</strong> in the repository itself, or in <strong>.git/info/attributes</strong>:
  <p>debian/changelog merge=dpkg-mergechangelogs
</div>
