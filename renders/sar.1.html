  <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
  <p>The <strong>sar</strong> command writes to standard output the contents of selected cumulative activity counters in the operating system. The accounting system, based on the values in the <em>count</em> and <em>interval</em> parameters, writes information the specified number of times spaced at the specified intervals in seconds. If the <em>interval</em> parameter is set to zero, the <strong>sar</strong> command displays the average statistics for the time since the system was started. If the <em>interval</em> parameter is specified without the <em>count</em> parameter, then reports are generated continuously. The collected data can also be saved in the file specified by the -o <em>filename</em> flag, in addition to being displayed onto the screen. If <em>filename</em> is omitted, <strong>sar</strong> uses the standard system activity daily data file (see below). By default all the data available from the kernel are saved in the data file.<br>
  <br>
  The <strong>sar</strong> command extracts and writes to standard output records previously saved in a file. This file can be either the one specified by the -f flag or, by default, the standard system activity daily data file. It is also possible to enter -1, -2 etc. as an argument to <strong>sar</strong> to display data of that days ago. For example, -1 will point at the standard system activity file of yesterday.<br>
  <br>
  Standard system activity daily data files are named <em>saDD</em> or <em>saYYYYMMDD</em>, where YYYY stands for the current year, MM for the current month and DD for the current day. They are the default files used by <strong>sar</strong> only when no filename has been explicitly specified. When used to write data to files (with its option -o), <strong>sar</strong> will use <em>saYYYYMMDD</em> if option -D has also been specified, else it will use <em>saDD</em>. When used to display the records previously saved in a file, <strong>sar</strong> will look for the most recent of <em>saDD</em> and <em>saYYYYMMDD</em>, and use it.<br>
  <br>
  Standard system activity daily data files are located in the <em>/var/log/sa</em> directory by default. Yet it is possible to specify an alternate location for them: If a directory (instead of a plain file) is used with options -f or -o then it will be considered as the directory containing the data files.<br>
  <br>
  Without the -P flag, the <strong>sar</strong> command reports system-wide (global among all processors) statistics, which are calculated as averages for values expressed as percentages, and as sums otherwise. If the -P flag is given, the <strong>sar</strong> command reports activity which relates to the specified processor or processors. If -P ALL is given, the <strong>sar</strong> command reports statistics for each individual processor and global statistics among all processors.<br>
  <br>
  You can select information about specific system activities using flags. Not specifying any flags selects only CPU activity. Specifying the -A flag selects all possible activities.<br>
  <br>
  The default version of the <strong>sar</strong> command (CPU utilization report) might be one of the first facilities the user runs to begin system activity investigation, because it monitors major system resources. If CPU utilization is near 100 percent (user + nice + system), the workload sampled is CPU-bound.<br>
  <br>
  If multiple samples and multiple reports are desired, it is convenient to specify an output file for the <strong>sar</strong> command. Run the <strong>sar</strong> command as a background process. The syntax for this is:<br>
  <br>
  <strong>sar -o datafile interval count &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 &</strong><br>
  <br>
  All data are captured in binary form and saved to a file (datafile). The data can then be selectively displayed with the <strong>sar</strong> command using the -f option. Set the <em>interval</em> and <em>count</em> parameters to select <em>count</em> records at <em>interval</em> second intervals. If the <em>count</em> parameter is not set, all the records saved in the file will be selected. Collection of data in this manner is useful to characterize system usage over a period of time and determine peak usage hours.<br>
  <br>
  Note: The <strong>sar</strong> command only reports on local activities.

  <h2>OPTIONS</h2>
  <dl>
    <dt>-A
    <dd>This is equivalent to specifying <strong>-bBdFHqRSuvwWy -I SUM -I XALL -m ALL -n ALL -r ALL -u ALL -P ALL</strong>.
    <dt>-B
    <dd>
      <p>Report paging statistics. The following values are displayed:<br>
      <br>
      <strong>pgpgin/s</strong>
      <p>Total number of kilobytes the system paged in from disk per second.
      <p><strong>pgpgout/s</strong>
      <p>Total number of kilobytes the system paged out to disk per second.
      <p><strong>fault/s</strong>
      <p>Number of page faults (major + minor) made by the system per second. This is not a count of page faults that generate I/O, because some page faults can be resolved without I/O.
      <p><strong>majflt/s</strong>
      <p>Number of major faults the system has made per second, those which have required loading a memory page from disk.
      <p><strong>pgfree/s</strong>
      <p>Number of pages placed on the free list by the system per second.
      <p><strong>pgscank/s</strong>
      <p>Number of pages scanned by the kswapd daemon per second.
      <p><strong>pgscand/s</strong>
      <p>Number of pages scanned directly per second.
      <p><strong>pgsteal/s</strong>
      <p>Number of pages the system has reclaimed from cache (pagecache and swapcache) per second to satisfy its memory demands.
      <p><strong>%vmeff</strong>
      <p>Calculated as pgsteal / pgscan, this is a metric of the efficiency of page reclaim. If it is near 100% then almost every page coming off the tail of the inactive list is being reaped. If it gets too low (e.g. less than 30%) then the virtual memory is having some difficulty. This field is displayed as zero if no pages have been scanned during the interval of time.
    <dt>-b
    <dd>
      <p>Report I/O and transfer rate statistics. The following values are displayed:<br>
      <br>
      <strong>tps</strong>
      <p>Total number of transfers per second that were issued to physical devices. A transfer is an I/O request to a physical device. Multiple logical requests can be combined into a single I/O request to the device. A transfer is of indeterminate size.
      <p><strong>rtps</strong>
      <p>Total number of read requests per second issued to physical devices.
      <p><strong>wtps</strong>
      <p>Total number of write requests per second issued to physical devices.
      <p><strong>bread/s</strong>
      <p>Total amount of data read from the devices in blocks per second. Blocks are equivalent to sectors and therefore have a size of 512 bytes.
      <p><strong>bwrtn/s</strong>
      <p>Total amount of data written to devices in blocks per second.
    <dt>-C
    <dd>When reading data from a file, tell <strong>sar</strong> to display comments that have been inserted by <strong>sadc</strong>.
    <dt>-D
    <dd>Use <em>saYYYYMMDD</em> instead of <em>saDD</em> as the standard system activity daily data file name. This option works only when used in conjunction with option -o to save data to file.
    <dt>-d
    <dd>
      <p>Report activity for each block device. When data are displayed, the device specification <em>devM-n</em> is generally used (DEV column). M is the major number of the device and n its minor number. Device names may also be pretty-printed if option -p is used or persistent device names can be printed if option -j is used (see below). Note that disk activity depends on <strong>sadc</strong> options <strong>-S DISK</strong> and <strong>-S XDISK</strong> to be collected. The following values are displayed:<br>
      <br>
      <strong>tps</strong>
      <p>Total number of transfers per second that were issued to physical devices. A transfer is an I/O request to a physical device. Multiple logical requests can be combined into a single I/O request to the device. A transfer is of indeterminate size.
      <p><strong>rd_sec/s</strong>
      <p>Number of sectors read from the device. The size of a sector is 512 bytes.

      <p><strong>avgqu-sz</strong>
      <p>The average queue length of the requests that were issued to the device.
      <p><strong>await</strong>
      <p>The average time (in milliseconds) for I/O requests issued to the device to be served. This includes the time spent by the requests in queue and the time spent servicing them.
      <p><strong>svctm</strong>
      <p>The average service time (in milliseconds) for I/O requests that were issued to the device. Warning! Do not trust this field any more. This field will be removed in a future sysstat version.
      <p><strong>%util</strong>
      <p>Percentage of elapsed time during which I/O requests were issued to the device (bandwidth utilization for the device). Device saturation occurs when this value is close to 100% for devices serving requests serially. But for devices serving requests in parallel, such as RAID arrays and modern SSDs, this number does not reflect their performance limits.
    <dt>-e [ hh:mm[:ss] ]
    <dd>Set the ending time of the report. The default ending time is 18:00:00. Hours must be given in 24-hour format. This option can be used when data are read from or written to a file (options -f or -o).
    <dt>-F [ MOUNT ]
    <dd>
      <p>Display statistics for currently mounted filesystems. Pseudo-filesystems are ignored. At the end of the report, <strong>sar</strong> will display a summary of all those filesystems. Use of the <strong>MOUNT</strong> parameter keyword indicates that mountpoint will be reported instead of filesystem device.

      <p>Percentage of file nodes used in filesystem.
    <dt>-f [ filename ]
    <dd>Extract records from <em>filename</em> (created by the -o <em>filename</em> flag). The default value of the <em>filename</em> parameter is the current standard system activity daily data file. If <em>filename</em> is a directory instead of a plain file then it is considered as the directory where the standard system activity daily data files are located. The -f option is exclusive of the -o option.
    <dt>-H

    <dt>-I { int [,...] | SUM | ALL | XALL }
    <dd>Report statistics for a given interrupt. <em>int</em> is the interrupt number. Specifying multiple -I <em>int</em> parameters on the command line will look at multiple independent interrupts. The <strong>SUM</strong> keyword indicates that the total number of interrupts received per second is to be displayed. The <strong>ALL</strong> keyword indicates that statistics from the first 16 interrupts are to be reported, whereas the <strong>XALL</strong> keyword indicates that statistics from all interrupts, including potential APIC interrupt sources, are to be reported. Note that interrupt statistics depend on <strong>sadc</strong> option "-S INT" to be collected.
    <dt>-i interval
    <dd>Select data records at seconds as close as possible to the number specified by the <em>interval</em> parameter.
    <dt>-j { ID | LABEL | PATH | UUID | ... }
    <dd>Display persistent device names. Use this option in conjunction with option -d. Options <strong>ID</strong>, <strong>LABEL</strong>, etc. specify the type of the persistent name. These options are not limited, only prerequisite is that directory with required persistent names is present in <em>/dev/disk</em>. If persistent name is not found for the device, the device name is pretty-printed (see option -p below).
    <dt>-m { keyword [,...] | ALL }
    <dd>

The estimate takes into account that the system needs some page cache to function well, and that not all reclaimable slab will be reclaimable, due to items being in use. The impact of those factors will vary from system to system.
      <p><strong>kbmemused</strong>
      <p>Amount of used memory in kilobytes. This does not take into account memory used by the kernel itself.
      <p><strong>%memused</strong>
      <p>Percentage of used memory.
      <p><strong>kbbuffers</strong>
      <p>Amount of memory used as buffers by the kernel in kilobytes.
      <p><strong>kbcached</strong>
      <p>Amount of memory used to cache data by the kernel in kilobytes.
      <p><strong>kbcommit</strong>
      <p>Amount of memory in kilobytes needed for current workload. This is an estimate of how much RAM/swap is needed to guarantee that there never is out of memory.
      <p><strong>%commit</strong>
      <p>Percentage of memory needed for current workload in relation to the total amount of memory (RAM+swap). This number may be greater than 100% because the kernel usually overcommits memory.
      <p><strong>kbactive</strong>
      <p>Amount of active memory in kilobytes (memory that has been used more recently and usually not reclaimed unless absolutely necessary).
      <p><strong>kbinact</strong>
      <p>Amount of inactive memory in kilobytes (memory which has been less recently used. It is more eligible to be reclaimed for other purposes).
      <p><strong>kbdirty</strong>
      <p>Amount of memory in kilobytes waiting to get written back to the disk.
      <p><strong>kbanonpg</strong>
      <p>Amount of non-file backed pages in kilobytes mapped into userspace page tables.
      <p><strong>kbslab</strong>
      <p>Amount of memory in kilobytes used by the kernel to cache data structures for its own use.
      <p><strong>kbkstack</strong>
      <p>Amount of memory in kilobytes used for kernel stack space.
      <p><strong>kbpgtbl</strong>
      <p>Amount of memory in kilobytes dedicated to the lowest level of page tables.
      <p><strong>kbvmused</strong>
      <p>Amount of memory in kilobytes of used virtual address space.

      <p>Amount of used swap space in kilobytes.
      <p><strong>%swpused</strong>
      <p>Percentage of used swap space.
      <p><strong>kbswpcad</strong>
      <p>Amount of cached swap memory in kilobytes. This is memory that once was swapped out, is swapped back in but still also is in the swap area (if memory is needed it doesn't need to be swapped out again because it is already in the swap area. This saves I/O).
      <p><strong>%swpcad</strong>
      <p>Percentage of cached swap memory in relation to the amount of used swap space.
    <dt>-s [ hh:mm[:ss] ]
    <dd>Set the starting time of the data, causing the <strong>sar</strong> command to extract records time-tagged at, or following, the time specified. The default starting time is 08:00:00.

    <dt>-t
    <dd>When reading data from a daily data file, indicate that <strong>sar</strong> should display the timestamps in the original local time of the data file creator. Without this option, the <strong>sar</strong> command displays the timestamps in the user's locale time.
    <dt>-u [ ALL ]
    <dd>

  <h2>ENVIRONMENT</h2>
  <p>The <strong>sar</strong> command takes into account the following environment variables:
  <dl>
    <dt>S_COLORS
    <dd>When this variable is set, display statistics in color on the terminal. Possible values for this variable are <em>never</em>, <em>always</em> or <em>auto</em> (the latter is the default).<br>
    <br>
    Please note that the color (being red, yellow, or some other color) used to display a value is not indicative of any kind of issue simply because of the color. It only indicates different ranges of values.
    <dt>S_COLORS_SGR
    <dd>
      <p>Specify the colors and other attributes used to display statistics on the terminal. Its value is a colon-separated list of capabilities that defaults to <strong>C=36;22:H=31;1:I=32;22:M=34;1:N=33;1:R=31;22:Z=33;22</strong>. Supported capabilities are:
      <dl>
        <dt><strong>C=</strong>
        <dd>SGR (Select Graphic Rendition) substring for comments inserted in the binary daily data files.
        <dt><strong>H=</strong>
        <dd>SGR substring for percentage values greater than or equal to 75%.
        <dt><strong>I=</strong>
        <dd>SGR substring for item names or values (eg. network interfaces, CPU number...)
        <dt><strong>M=</strong>
        <dd>SGR substring for percentage values in the range from 50% to 75%.
        <dt><strong>N=</strong>
        <dd>SGR substring for non-zero statistics values.
        <dt><strong>R=</strong>
        <dd>SGR substring for restart messages.
        <dt><strong>Z=</strong>
        <dd>SGR substring for zero values.
      </dl>
    <dt>S_TIME_DEF_TIME
    <dd>If this variable exists and its value is <strong>UTC</strong> then <strong>sar</strong> will save its data in UTC time (data will still be displayed in local time). <strong>sar</strong> will also use UTC time instead of local time to determine the current daily data file located in the <em>/var/log/sa</em> directory. This variable may be useful for servers with users located across several timezones.
    <dt>S_TIME_FORMAT
    <dd>If this variable exists and its value is <strong>ISO</strong> then the current locale will be ignored when printing the date in the report header. The <strong>sar</strong> command will use the ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD) instead. The timestamp will also be compliant with ISO 8601 format.

  <h2>EXAMPLES</h2>
  <p><strong>sar -u 2 5</strong>
  <div class="indent">
    <p>Report CPU utilization for each 2 seconds. 5 lines are displayed.
  </div>
  <p><strong>sar -I 14 -o int14.file 2 10</strong>
  <div class="indent">
    <p>Report statistics on IRQ 14 for each 2 seconds. 10 lines are displayed. Data are stored in a file called <em>int14.file</em>.
  </div>
  <p><strong>sar -r -n DEV -f /var/log/sa/sa16</strong>
  <div class="indent">
    <p>Display memory and network statistics saved in daily data file 'sa16'.
  </div>
  <p><strong>sar -A</strong>
  <div class="indent">
    <p>Display all the statistics saved in current daily data file.
  </div>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>BUGS</h2>
  <p><em>/proc</em> filesystem must be mounted for the <strong>sar</strong> command to work.<br>
  <br>
  All the statistics are not necessarily available, depending on the kernel version used. <strong>sar</strong> assumes that you are using at least a 2.6 kernel.
</section>
<section>
  <h2>FILES</h2>
  <p><em>/var/log/sa/saDD</em><br>
  <em>/var/log/sa/saYYYYMMDD</em>
  <div class="indent">
    <p>The standard system activity daily data files and their default location. YYYY stands for the current year, MM for the current month and DD for the current day.
  </div>
  <p><em>/proc</em> and <em>/sys</em> contain various files with system statistics.
