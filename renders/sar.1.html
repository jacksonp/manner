    <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
    <p>The <strong>sar</strong> command writes to standard output the contents of selected cumulative activity counters in the operating system. The accounting system, based on the values in the <em>count</em> and <em>interval</em> parameters, writes information the specified number of times spaced at the specified intervals in seconds. If the <em>interval</em> parameter is set to zero, the <strong>sar</strong> command displays the average statistics for the time since the system was started. If the <em>interval</em> parameter is specified without the <em>count</em> parameter, then reports are generated continuously. The collected data can also be saved in the file specified by the -o <em>filename</em> flag, in addition to being displayed onto the screen. If <em>filename</em> is omitted, <strong>sar</strong> uses the standard system activity daily data file (see below). By default all the data available from the kernel are saved in the data file. The <strong>sar</strong> command extracts and writes to standard output records previously saved in a file. This file can be either the one specified by the -f flag or, by default, the standard system activity daily data file. It is also possible to enter -1, -2 etc. as an argument to <strong>sar</strong> to display data of that days ago. For example, -1 will point at the standard system activity file of yesterday. Standard system activity daily data files are named <em>saDD</em> or <em>saYYYYMMDD</em>, where YYYY stands for the current year, MM for the current month and DD for the current day. They are the default files used by <strong>sar</strong> only when no filename has been explicitly specified. When used to write data to files (with its option -o), <strong>sar</strong> will use <em>saYYYYMMDD</em> if option -D has also been specified, else it will use <em>saDD</em>. When used to display the records previously saved in a file, <strong>sar</strong> will look for the most recent of <em>saDD</em> and <em>saYYYYMMDD</em>, and use it. Standard system activity daily data files are located in the <em>/var/log/sa</em> directory by default. Yet it is possible to specify an alternate location for them: If a directory (instead of a plain file) is used with options -f or -o then it will be considered as the directory containing the data files. Without the -P flag, the <strong>sar</strong> command reports system-wide (global among all processors) statistics, which are calculated as averages for values expressed as percentages, and as sums otherwise. If the -P flag is given, the <strong>sar</strong> command reports activity which relates to the specified processor or processors. If -P ALL is given, the <strong>sar</strong> command reports statistics for each individual processor and global statistics among all processors. You can select information about specific system activities using flags. Not specifying any flags selects only CPU activity. Specifying the -A flag selects all possible activities. The default version of the <strong>sar</strong> command (CPU utilization report) might be one of the first facilities the user runs to begin system activity investigation, because it monitors major system resources. If CPU utilization is near 100 percent (user + nice + system), the workload sampled is CPU-bound. If multiple samples and multiple reports are desired, it is convenient to specify an output file for the <strong>sar</strong> command. Run the <strong>sar</strong> command as a background process. The syntax for this is: <strong>sar -o datafile interval count &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 &</strong> All data are captured in binary form and saved to a file (datafile). The data can then be selectively displayed with the <strong>sar</strong> command using the -f option. Set the <em>interval</em> and <em>count</em> parameters to select <em>count</em> records at <em>interval</em> second intervals. If the <em>count</em> parameter is not set, all the records saved in the file will be selected. Collection of data in this manner is useful to characterize system usage over a period of time and determine peak usage hours. Note: The <strong>sar</strong> command only reports on local activities.

    <h2>OPTIONS</h2>
    <p><em>P -A</em> This is equivalent to specifying <strong>-bBdFHqRSuvwWy -I SUM -I XALL -m ALL -n ALL -r ALL -u ALL -P ALL.</strong> <em>P -B</em> Report paging statistics. The following values are displayed: <strong>pgpgin/s</strong> S S Total number of kilobytes the system paged in from disk per second. E <strong>pgpgout/s</strong> S Total number of kilobytes the system paged out to disk per second. E <strong>fault/s</strong> S Number of page faults (major + minor) made by the system per second. This is not a count of page faults that generate I/O, because some page faults can be resolved without I/O. E <strong>majflt/s</strong> S Number of major faults the system has made per second, those which have required loading a memory page from disk. E <strong>pgfree/s</strong> S Number of pages placed on the free list by the system per second. E <strong>pgscank/s</strong> S Number of pages scanned by the kswapd daemon per second. E <strong>pgscand/s</strong> S Number of pages scanned directly per second. E <strong>pgsteal/s</strong> S Number of pages the system has reclaimed from cache (pagecache and swapcache) per second to satisfy its memory demands. E <strong>%vmeff</strong> S Calculated as pgsteal / pgscan, this is a metric of the efficiency of page reclaim. If it is near 100% then almost every page coming off the tail of the inactive list is being reaped. If it gets too low (e.g. less than 30%) then the virtual memory is having some difficulty. This field is displayed as zero if no pages have been scanned during the interval of time. E E <em>P -b</em> Report I/O and transfer rate statistics. The following values are displayed: <strong>tps</strong> S S Total number of transfers per second that were issued to physical devices. A transfer is an I/O request to a physical device. Multiple logical requests can be combined into a single I/O request to the device. A transfer is of indeterminate size. E <strong>rtps</strong> S Total number of read requests per second issued to physical devices. E <strong>wtps</strong> S Total number of write requests per second issued to physical devices. E <strong>bread/s</strong> S Total amount of data read from the devices in blocks per second. Blocks are equivalent to sectors and therefore have a size of 512 bytes. E <strong>bwrtn/s</strong> S Total amount of data written to devices in blocks per second. E E <em>P -C</em> When reading data from a file, tell <strong>sar</strong> to display comments that have been inserted by <strong>sadc</strong>. <em>P -D</em> Use <em>saYYYYMMDD</em> instead of <em>saDD</em> as the standard system activity daily data file name. This option works only when used in conjunction with option -o to save data to file. <em>P -d</em> Report activity for each block device. When data are displayed, the device specification <em>devM-n</em> is generally used (DEV column). M is the major number of the device and n its minor number. Device names may also be pretty-printed if option -p is used or persistent device names can be printed if option -j is used (see below). Note that disk activity depends on <strong>sadc</strong> options <strong>-S DISK</strong> and <strong>-S XDISK</strong> to be collected. The following values are displayed: <strong>tps</strong> S S Indicate the number of transfers per second that were issued to the device. Multiple logical requests can be combined into a single I/O request to the device. A transfer is of indeterminate size. E <strong>rd_sec/s</strong> S Number of sectors read from the device. The size of a sector is 512 bytes. E <strong>wr_sec/s</strong> S Number of sectors written to the device. The size of a sector is 512 bytes. E <strong>avgrq-sz</strong> S The average size (in sectors) of the requests that were issued to the device. E <strong>avgqu-sz</strong> S The average queue length of the requests that were issued to the device. E <strong>await</strong> S The average time (in milliseconds) for I/O requests issued to the device to be served. This includes the time spent by the requests in queue and the time spent servicing them. E <strong>svctm</strong> S The average service time (in milliseconds) for I/O requests that were issued to the device. Warning! Do not trust this field any more. This field will be removed in a future sysstat version. E <strong>%util</strong> S Percentage of elapsed time during which I/O requests were issued to the device (bandwidth utilization for the device). Device saturation occurs when this value is close to 100% for devices serving requests serially. But for devices serving requests in parallel, such as RAID arrays and modern SSDs, this number does not reflect their performance limits. E E <em>P "-e [ hh:mm[:ss] ]</em> Set the ending time of the report. The default ending time is 18:00:00. Hours must be given in 24-hour format. This option can be used when data are read from or written to a file (options -f or -o). <em>P "-F [ MOUNT ]</em> Display statistics for currently mounted filesystems. Pseudo-filesystems are ignored. At the end of the report, <strong>sar</strong> will display a summary of all those filesystems. Use of the <strong>MOUNT</strong> parameter keyword indicates that mountpoint will be reported instead of filesystem device. Note that filesystems statistics depend on <strong>sadc</strong> option <strong>-S XDISK</strong> to be collected. The following values are displayed: <strong>MBfsfree</strong> S S Total amount a free space in megabytes (including space available only to privileged user). E <strong>MBfsused</strong> S Total amount of space used in megabytes. E <strong>%fsused</strong> S Percentage of filesystem space used, as seen by a privileged user. E <strong>%ufsused</strong> S Percentage of filesystem space used, as seen by an unprivileged user. E <strong>Ifree</strong> S Total number of free file nodes in filesystem. E <strong>Iused</strong> S Total number of file nodes used in filesystem. E <strong>%Iused</strong> S Percentage of file nodes used in filesystem. E E <em>P "-f [ filename ]</em> Extract records from <em>filename</em> (created by the -o <em>filename</em> flag). The default value of the <em>filename</em> parameter is the current standard system activity daily data file. If <em>filename</em> is a directory instead of a plain file then it is considered as the directory where the standard system activity daily data files are located. The -f option is exclusive of the -o option. <em>P -H</em> Report hugepages utilization statistics. The following values are displayed: <strong>kbhugfree</strong> S S Amount of hugepages memory in kilobytes that is not yet allocated. E <strong>kbhugused</strong> S Amount of hugepages memory in kilobytes that has been allocated. E <strong>%hugused</strong> S Percentage of total hugepages memory that has been allocated. E E <em>P -h</em> Display a short help message then exit. <em>P "-I { int [,...] | SUM | ALL | XALL }</em> Report statistics for a given interrupt. <em>int</em> is the interrupt number. Specifying multiple -I <em>int</em> parameters on the command line will look at multiple independent interrupts. The <strong>SUM</strong> keyword indicates that the total number of interrupts received per second is to be displayed. The <strong>ALL</strong> keyword indicates that statistics from the first 16 interrupts are to be reported, whereas the <strong>XALL</strong> keyword indicates that statistics from all interrupts, including potential APIC interrupt sources, are to be reported. Note that interrupt statistics depend on <strong>sadc</strong> option "-S INT" to be collected. <em>P "-i interval</em> Select data records at seconds as close as possible to the number specified by the <em>interval</em> parameter. <em>P "-j { ID | LABEL | PATH | UUID | ... }</em> Display persistent device names. Use this option in conjunction with option -d. Options <strong>ID</strong>, <strong>LABEL</strong>, etc. specify the type of the persistent name. These options are not limited, only prerequisite is that directory with required persistent names is present in <em>/dev/disk</em>. If persistent name is not found for the device, the device name is pretty-printed (see option -p below). <em>P "-m { keyword [,...] | ALL }</em> Report power management statistics. Note that these statistics depend on <strong>sadc</strong>'s option "-S POWER" to be collected. Possible keywords are <strong>CPU</strong>, <strong>FAN</strong>, <strong>FREQ</strong>, <strong>IN</strong>, <strong>TEMP</strong> and <strong>USB</strong>. With the <strong>CPU</strong> keyword, statistics about CPU are reported. The following value is displayed: <strong>MHz</strong> S S Instantaneous CPU clock frequency in MHz. E With the <strong>FAN</strong> keyword, statistics about fans speed are reported. The following values are displayed: <strong>rpm</strong> S Fan speed expressed in revolutions per minute. E <strong>drpm</strong> S This field is calculated as the difference between current fan speed (rpm) and its low limit (fan_min). E <strong>DEVICE</strong> S Sensor device name. E With the <strong>FREQ</strong> keyword, statistics about CPU clock frequency are reported. The following value is displayed: <strong>wghMHz</strong> S Weighted average CPU clock frequency in MHz. Note that the cpufreq-stats driver must be compiled in the kernel for this option to work. E With the <strong>IN</strong> keyword, statistics about voltage inputs are reported. The following values are displayed: <strong>inV</strong> S Voltage input expressed in Volts. E <strong>%in</strong> S Relative input value. A value of 100% means that voltage input has reached its high limit (in_max) whereas a value of 0% means that it has reached its low limit (in_min). E <strong>DEVICE</strong> S Sensor device name. E With the <strong>TEMP</strong> keyword, statistics about devices temperature are reported. The following values are displayed: <strong>degC</strong> S Device temperature expressed in degrees Celsius. E <strong>%temp</strong> S Relative device temperature. A value of 100% means that temperature has reached its high limit (temp_max). E <strong>DEVICE</strong> S Sensor device name. E With the <strong>USB</strong> keyword, the <strong>sar</strong> command takes a snapshot of all the USB devices currently plugged into the system. At the end of the report, <strong>sar</strong> will display a summary of all those USB devices. The following values are displayed: <strong>BUS</strong> S Root hub number of the USB device. E <strong>idvendor</strong> S Vendor ID number (assigned by USB organization). E <strong>idprod</strong> S Product ID number (assigned by Manufacturer). E <strong>maxpower</strong> S Maximum power consumption of the device (expressed in mA). E <strong>manufact</strong> S Manufacturer name. E <strong>product</strong> S Product name. E The <strong>ALL</strong> keyword is equivalent to specifying all the keywords above and therefore all the power management statistics are reported. E E <em>P "-n { keyword [,...] | ALL }</em> Report network statistics. Possible keywords are <strong>DEV</strong>, <strong>EDEV</strong>, <strong>NFS</strong>, <strong>NFSD</strong>, <strong>SOCK</strong>, <strong>IP</strong>, <strong>EIP</strong>, <strong>ICMP</strong>, <strong>EICMP</strong>, <strong>TCP</strong>, <strong>ETCP</strong>, <strong>UDP</strong>, <strong>SOCK6</strong>, <strong>IP6</strong>, <strong>EIP6</strong>, <strong>ICMP6</strong>, <strong>EICMP6</strong>, <strong>UDP6</strong> and <strong>FC</strong>.

E With the <strong>EIP</strong> keyword, statistics about IPv4 network errors are reported. Note that IPv4 statistics depend on <strong>sadc</strong>'s option "-S SNMP" to be collected. The following values are displayed (formal SNMP names between square brackets): <strong>ihdrerr/s</strong> S The number of input datagrams discarded per second due to errors in their IP headers, including bad checksums, version number mismatch, other format errors, time-to-live exceeded, errors discovered in processing their IP options, etc. [ipInHdrErrors] E <strong>iadrerr/s</strong> S The number of input datagrams discarded per second because the IP address in their IP header's destination field was not a valid address to be received at this entity. This count includes invalid addresses (e.g., 0.0.0.0) and addresses of unsupported Classes (e.g., Class E). For entities which are not IP routers and therefore do not forward datagrams, this counter includes datagrams discarded because the destination address was not a local address [ipInAddrErrors].

E With the <strong>EIP6</strong> keyword, statistics about IPv6 network errors are reported. Note that IPv6 statistics depend on <strong>sadc</strong>'s option "-S IPV6" to be collected. The following values are displayed (formal SNMP names between square brackets): <strong>ihdrer6/s</strong> S The number of input datagrams discarded per second due to errors in their IPv6 headers, including version number mismatch, other format errors, hop count exceeded, errors discovered in processing their IPv6 options, etc. [ipv6IfStatsInHdrErrors] E <strong>iadrer6/s</strong> S The number of input datagrams discarded per second because the IPv6 address in their IPv6 header's destination field was not a valid address to be received at this entity. This count includes invalid addresses (e.g., ::0) and unsupported addresses (e.g., addresses with unallocated prefixes).

E <strong>odisc6/s</strong> S The number of output IPv6 datagrams per second for which no problem was encountered to prevent their transmission to their destination, but which were discarded (e.g., for lack of buffer space) [ipv6IfStatsOutDiscards]. Note that this counter would include datagrams counted in fwddgm6/s if any such packets met this (discretionary) discard criterion.

E <strong>asmf6/s</strong> S The number of failures detected per second by the IPv6 re-assembly algorithm (for whatever reason: timed out, errors, etc.) [ipv6IfStatsReasmFails]. Note that this is not necessarily a count of discarded IPv6 fragments since some algorithms can lose track of the number of fragments by combining them as they are received. E <strong>fragf6/s</strong> S The number of IPv6 datagrams that have been discarded per second because they needed to be fragmented at this output interface but could not be [ipv6IfStatsOutFragFails]. E <strong>itrpck6/s</strong> S The number of input datagrams discarded per second because datagram frame didn't carry enough data [ipv6IfStatsInTruncatedPkts].

E The <strong>ALL</strong> keyword is equivalent to specifying all the keywords above and therefore all the network activities are reported. E E <em>P "-o [ filename ]</em> Save the readings in the file in binary form. Each reading is in a separate record. The default value of the <em>filename</em> parameter is the current standard system activity daily data file. If <em>filename</em> is a directory instead of a plain file then it is considered as the directory where the standard system activity daily data files are located. The -o option is exclusive of the -f option. All the data available from the kernel are saved in the file (in fact, <strong>sar</strong> calls its data collector <strong>sadc</strong> with the option "-S ALL". See <strong>sadc</strong>(8) manual page). <em>P "-P { cpu [,...] | ALL }</em> Report per-processor statistics for the specified processor or processors. Specifying the <strong>ALL</strong> keyword reports statistics for each individual processor, and globally for all processors. Note that processor 0 is the first processor. <em>P -p</em> Pretty-print device names. Use this option in conjunction with option -d. By default names are printed as <em>devM-n</em> where M and n are the major and minor numbers for the device. Use of this option displays the names of the devices as they (should) appear in /dev. Name mappings are controlled by <em>/etc/sysconfig/sysstat.ioconf</em>. <em>P -q</em> Report queue length and load averages. The following values are displayed: <strong>runq-sz</strong> S S Run queue length (number of tasks waiting for run time). E <strong>plist-sz</strong> S Number of tasks in the task list. E <strong>ldavg-1</strong> S System load average for the last minute. The load average is calculated as the average number of runnable or running tasks (R state), and the number of tasks in uninterruptible sleep (D state) over the specified interval. E <strong>ldavg-5</strong> S System load average for the past 5 minutes. E <strong>ldavg-15</strong> S System load average for the past 15 minutes. E <strong>blocked</strong> S Number of tasks currently blocked, waiting for I/O to complete. E E <em>P -R</em> Report memory statistics. The following values are displayed: <strong>frmpg/s</strong> S S Number of memory pages freed by the system per second. A negative value represents a number of pages allocated by the system. Note that a page has a size of 4 kiB or 8 kiB according to the machine architecture. E <strong>bufpg/s</strong> S Number of additional memory pages used as buffers by the system per second. A negative value means fewer pages used as buffers by the system. E <strong>campg/s</strong> S Number of additional memory pages cached by the system per second. A negative value means fewer pages in the cache. E E <em>P "-r [ ALL ]</em> Report memory utilization statistics. The <strong>ALL</strong> keyword indicates that all the memory fields should be displayed. The following values may be displayed: <strong>kbmemfree</strong> S S Amount of free memory available in kilobytes. E <strong>kbmemused</strong> S Amount of used memory in kilobytes. This does not take into account memory used by the kernel itself. E <strong>%memused</strong> S Percentage of used memory. E <strong>kbbuffers</strong> S Amount of memory used as buffers by the kernel in kilobytes. E <strong>kbcached</strong> S Amount of memory used to cache data by the kernel in kilobytes. E <strong>kbcommit</strong> S Amount of memory in kilobytes needed for current workload. This is an estimate of how much RAM/swap is needed to guarantee that there never is out of memory. E <strong>%commit</strong> S Percentage of memory needed for current workload in relation to the total amount of memory (RAM+swap). This number may be greater than 100% because the kernel usually overcommits memory. E <strong>kbactive</strong> S Amount of active memory in kilobytes (memory that has been used more recently and usually not reclaimed unless absolutely necessary). E <strong>kbinact</strong> S Amount of inactive memory in kilobytes (memory which has been less recently used. It is more eligible to be reclaimed for other purposes). E <strong>kbdirty</strong> S Amount of memory in kilobytes waiting to get written back to the disk. E <strong>kbanonpg</strong> S Amount of non-file backed pages in kilobytes mapped into userspace page tables. E <strong>kbslab</strong> S Amount of memory in kilobytes used by the kernel to cache data structures for its own use. E <strong>kbkstack</strong> S Amount of memory in kilobytes used for kernel stack space. E <strong>kbpgtbl</strong> S Amount of memory in kilobytes dedicated to the lowest level of page tables. E <strong>kbvmused</strong> S Amount of memory in kilobytes of used virtual address space. E E <em>P -S</em> Report swap space utilization statistics. The following values are displayed: <strong>kbswpfree</strong> S S Amount of free swap space in kilobytes. E <strong>kbswpused</strong> S Amount of used swap space in kilobytes. E <strong>%swpused</strong> S Percentage of used swap space. E <strong>kbswpcad</strong> S Amount of cached swap memory in kilobytes. This is memory that once was swapped out, is swapped back in but still also is in the swap area (if memory is needed it doesn't need to be swapped out again because it is already in the swap area. This saves I/O). E <strong>%swpcad</strong> S Percentage of cached swap memory in relation to the amount of used swap space. E E <em>P "-s [ hh:mm[:ss] ]</em> Set the starting time of the data, causing the <strong>sar</strong> command to extract records time-tagged at, or following, the time specified. The default starting time is 08:00:00. Hours must be given in 24-hour format. This option can be used only when data are read from a file (option -f). <em>P "--sadc</em> Indicate which data collector is called by <strong>sar</strong>. If the data collector is sought in PATH then enter "which sadc" to know where it is located. <em>P -t</em> When reading data from a daily data file, indicate that <strong>sar</strong> should display the timestamps in the original local time of the data file creator. Without this option, the <strong>sar</strong> command displays the timestamps in the user's locale time. <em>P "-u [ ALL ]</em> Report CPU utilization. The <strong>ALL</strong> keyword indicates that all the CPU fields should be displayed. The report may show the following fields: <strong>%user</strong> S S Percentage of CPU utilization that occurred while executing at the user level (application). Note that this field includes time spent running virtual processors. E <strong>%usr</strong> S Percentage of CPU utilization that occurred while executing at the user level (application). Note that this field does NOT include time spent running virtual processors. E <strong>%nice</strong> S Percentage of CPU utilization that occurred while executing at the user level with nice priority. E <strong>%system</strong> S Percentage of CPU utilization that occurred while executing at the system level (kernel). Note that this field includes time spent servicing hardware and software interrupts.

Note that this field does NOT include time spent servicing hardware or software interrupts. E <strong>%iowait</strong> S Percentage of time that the CPU or CPUs were idle during which the system had an outstanding disk I/O request. E <strong>%steal</strong> S Percentage of time spent in involuntary wait by the virtual CPU or CPUs while the hypervisor was servicing another virtual processor. E <strong>%irq</strong> S Percentage of time spent by the CPU or CPUs to service hardware interrupts. E <strong>%soft</strong> S Percentage of time spent by the CPU or CPUs to service software interrupts. E <strong>%guest</strong> S Percentage of time spent by the CPU or CPUs to run a virtual processor. E <strong>%gnice</strong> S Percentage of time spent by the CPU or CPUs to run a niced guest. E <strong>%idle</strong> S Percentage of time that the CPU or CPUs were idle and the system did not have an outstanding disk I/O request. E Note: On SMP machines a processor that does not have any activity at all (0.00 for every field) is a disabled (offline) processor. E <em>P -V</em> Print version number then exit. <em>P -v</em> Report status of inode, file and other kernel tables. The following values are displayed: <strong>dentunusd</strong> S S Number of unused cache entries in the directory cache. E <strong>file-nr</strong> S Number of file handles used by the system. E <strong>inode-nr</strong> S Number of inode handlers used by the system. E <strong>pty-nr</strong> S Number of pseudo-terminals used by the system. E E <em>P -W</em> Report swapping statistics. The following values are displayed: <strong>pswpin/s</strong> S S Total number of swap pages the system brought in per second. E <strong>pswpout/s</strong> S Total number of swap pages the system brought out per second. E E <em>P -w</em> Report task creation and system switching activity. <strong>proc/s</strong> S S Total number of tasks created per second.

    <h2>ENVIRONMENT</h2>
    <p>The <strong>sar</strong> command takes into account the following environment variables: <em>P S_COLORS</em> When this variable is set, display statistics in color on the terminal. Possible values for this variable are <em>never</em>, <em>always</em> or <em>auto</em> (the latter is the default). Please note that the color (being red, yellow, or some other color) used to display a value is not indicative of any kind of issue simply because of the color. It only indicates different ranges of values. <em>P S_COLORS_SGR</em> Specify the colors and other attributes used to display statistics on the terminal. Its value is a colon-separated list of capabilities that defaults to <strong>C=36;22:H=31;1:I=32;22:M=34;1:N=33;1:R=31;22:Z=33;22</strong>. Supported capabilities are: S
    <dl>
      <dt><strong>C=</strong>
      <dd>SGR (Select Graphic Rendition) substring for comments inserted in the binary daily data files.
      <dt><strong>H=</strong>
      <dd>SGR substring for percentage values greater than or equal to 75%.
      <dt><strong>I=</strong>
      <dd>SGR substring for item names or values (eg. network interfaces, CPU number...)
      <dt><strong>M=</strong>
      <dd>SGR substring for percentage values in the range from 50% to 75%.
      <dt><strong>N=</strong>
      <dd>SGR substring for non-zero statistics values.
      <dt><strong>R=</strong>
      <dd>SGR substring for restart messages.
      <dt><strong>Z=</strong>
      <dd>SGR substring for zero values. E <em>P S_TIME_DEF_TIME</em> If this variable exists and its value is <strong>UTC</strong> then <strong>sar</strong> will save its data in UTC time (data will still be displayed in local time). <strong>sar</strong> will also use UTC time instead of local time to determine the current daily data file located in the <em>/var/log/sa</em> directory. This variable may be useful for servers with users located across several timezones. <em>P S_TIME_FORMAT</em> If this variable exists and its value is <strong>ISO</strong> then the current locale will be ignored when printing the date in the report header. The <strong>sar</strong> command will use the ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD) instead. The timestamp will also be compliant with ISO 8601 format.
