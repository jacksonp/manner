</section>

  <h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>
  <p><strong>bashbug</strong> [<em>--version</em>] [<em>--help</em>] [<em>email-address</em>]
</section>
<section>
  <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
  <p><strong>bashbug</strong> is a shell script to help the user compose and mail bug reports concerning bash in a standard format. <strong>bashbug</strong> invokes the editor specified by the environment variable <small><strong>EDITOR</strong></small> on a temporary copy of the bug report format outline. The user must fill in the appropriate fields and exit the editor. <strong>bashbug</strong> then mails the completed report to <em>bug-bash@gnu.org</em>, or <em>email-address</em>. &nbsp;If the report cannot be mailed, it is saved in the file <em>dead.bashbug</em> in the invoking user's home directory.
  <p>The bug report format outline consists of several sections. &nbsp;The first section provides information about the machine, operating system, the bash version, and the compilation environment. &nbsp;The second section should be filled in with a description of the bug. &nbsp;The third section should be a description of how to reproduce the bug. &nbsp;The optional fourth section is for a proposed fix. &nbsp;Fixes are encouraged.
