<h1>HTOP</h1>
<div class="section">
  <h2>NAME</h2>
  <p>htop - interactive process viewer
</div>
<div class="section">
  <h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>
  <p><strong>htop [<em>-dChusv</em>]</strong>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
  <p>Htop is a free (GPL) ncurses-based process viewer for Linux.
  <p>It is similar to top, but allows you to scroll vertically and horizontally, so you can see all the processes running on the system, along with their full command lines, as well as viewing them as a process tree, selecting multiple processes and acting on them all at once.
  <p>Tasks related to processes (killing, renicing) can be done without entering their PIDs.
</div>
<div class="section">
  <h2>COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS</h2>
  <p>Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

<div class="section">
  <h2>INTERACTIVE COMMANDS</h2>
  <p>The following commands are supported while in htop:
  <dl>
    <dt><strong>Arrows, PgUP, PgDn, Home, End</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Scroll the process list.
    <dt><strong>Space</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Tag or untag a process. Commands that can operate on multiple processes, like “kill”, will then apply over the list of tagged processes, instead of the currently highlighted one.
    <dt><strong>U</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Untag all processes (remove all tags added with the Space key).
    <dt><strong>s</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Trace process system calls: if strace(1) is installed, pressing this key will attach it to the currently selected process, presenting a live update of system calls issued by the process.
    <dt><strong>l</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Display open files for a process: if lsof(1) is installed, pressing this key will display the list of file descriptors opened by the process.
    <dt><strong>F1, h, ?</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Go to the help screen
    <dt><strong>F2, S</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Go to the setup screen, where you can configure the meters displayed at the top of the screen, set various display options, choose among color schemes, and select which columns are displayed, in which order.
    <dt><strong>F3, /</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Incrementally search the command lines of all the displayed processes. The currently selected (highlighted) command will update as you type. While in search mode, pressing F3 will cycle through matching occurrences.
    <dt><strong>F4, \\</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Incremental process filtering: type in part of a process command line and only processes whose names match will be shown. To cancel filtering, enter the Filter option again and press Esc.
    <dt><strong>F5, t</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Tree view: organize processes by parenthood, and layout the relations between them as a tree. Toggling the key will switch between tree and your previously selected sort view. Selecting a sort view will exit tree view.
    <dt><strong>F6</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>On sorted view, select a field for sorting, also accessible through &lt; and &gt;. The current sort field is indicated by a highlight in the header. On tree view, expand or collapse the current subtree. A “+” indicator in the tree node indicates that it is collapsed.
    <dt><strong>F7, ]</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Increase the selected process's priority (subtract from 'nice' value). This can only be done by the superuser.
    <dt><strong>F8, [</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Decrease the selected process's priority (add to 'nice' value)
    <dt><strong>F9, k</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>“Kill” process: sends a signal which is selected in a menu, to one or a group of processes. If processes were tagged, sends the signal to all tagged processes. If none is tagged, sends to the currently selected process.
    <dt><strong>F10, q</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Quit
    <dt><strong>I</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Invert the sort order: if sort order is increasing, switch to decreasing, and vice-versa.
    <dt><strong>+, -</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>When in tree view mode, expand or collapse subtree. When a subtree is collapsed a “+” sign shows to the left of the process name.
    <dt><strong>a (on multiprocessor machines)</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Set CPU affinity: mark which CPUs a process is allowed to use.
    <dt><strong>u</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Show only processes owned by a specified user.
    <dt><strong>M</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Sort by memory usage (top compatibility key).
    <dt><strong>P</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Sort by processor usage (top compatibility key).
    <dt><strong>T</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Sort by time (top compatibility key).
    <dt><strong>F</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>“Follow” process: if the sort order causes the currently selected process to move in the list, make the selection bar follow it. This is useful for monitoring a process: this way, you can keep a process always visible on screen. When a movement key is used, “follow” loses effect.
    <dt><strong>K</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Hide kernel threads: prevent the threads belonging the kernel to be displayed in the process list. (This is a toggle key.)
    <dt><strong>H</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Hide user threads: on systems that represent them differently than ordinary processes (such as recent NPTL-based systems), this can hide threads from userspace processes in the process list. (This is a toggle key.)
    <dt><strong>p</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Show full paths to running programs, where applicable. (This is a toggle key.)
    <dt><strong>Ctrl-L</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Refresh: redraw screen and recalculate values.
    <dt><strong>Numbers</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>PID search: type in process ID and the selection highlight will be moved to it.
  </dl>

  <h2>CONFIG FILE</h2>
  <p>By default htop reads its configuration from the XDG-compliant path ~/.config/htop/htoprc -- the configuration file is overwritten by htop's in-program Setup configuration, so it should not be hand-edited. If no user configuration exists htop tries to read the system-wide configuration from @sysconfdir@/htoprc and as a last resort, falls back to its hard coded defaults.
  <p>You may override the location of the configuration file using the $HTOPRC environment variable (so you can have multiple configurations for different machines that share the same home directory, for example).
</div>
<div class="section">
  <h2>MEMORY SIZES</h2>
  <p>Memory sizes in htop are displayed as they are in tools from the GNU Coreutils (when ran with the --human-readable option). This means that sizes are printed in powers of 1024. (e.g., 1023M = 1072693248 Bytes)
  <p>The decision to use this convention was made in order to conserve screen space and make memory size representations consistent throughout htop.

  <h2>AUTHORS</h2>
  <p>htop is developed by Hisham Muhammad &lt;hisham@gobolinux.org&gt;.
  <p>This man page was written by Bartosz Fenski &lt;fenio@o2.pl&gt; for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution (but it may be used by others). It was updated by Hisham Muhammad, and later by Vincent Launchbury, who wrote the 'Columns' section.
