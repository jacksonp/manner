  <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
  <p><strong>pmstat</strong> provides a one line summary of system performance every <em>interval</em> unit of time (the default is 5 seconds). <strong>pmstat</strong> is intended to monitor system performance at the highest level, after which other tools may be used to examine subsystems in which potential performance problems may be observed in greater detail.
  <p><strong>pcp-vmstat</strong> is a simple wrapper for use with the <strong>pcp</strong>(1) command, providing a more familiar command line format for some users. It also enables the extended reporting option by default, see the <em>-x</em> option below.
  <p>Multiple hosts may be monitored by supplying more than one host with multiple <strong>-h</strong> flags (for live monitoring) or by providing a name of the hostlist file, where each line contain one host name, with <strong>-H,</strong> or multiple <strong>-a</strong> flags (for retrospective monitoring from sets of archives).
  <p>The <strong>-t</strong> option may be used to change the default reporting <em>interval</em>. The <em>interval</em> argument follows the syntax described in <strong>PCPIntro</strong>(1), and in the simplest form may be an unsigned integer (the implied units in this case are seconds).
  <p>By default, <strong>pmstat</strong> fetches metrics by connecting to the Performance Metrics Collector Daemon (PMCD) on the local host. &nbsp;If the <strong>-L</strong> option is specified, then <strong>pmcd</strong>(1) is bypassed, and metrics are fetched from PMDAs on the local host using the standalone <strong>PM_CONTEXT_LOCAL</strong> variant of <strong>pmNewContext</strong>(3). When the <strong>-h</strong> option is specified, <strong>pmstat</strong> connects to the <strong>pmcd</strong>(1) on <em>host</em> and fetches metrics from there. As mentioned above, multiple hosts may be monitored by supplying multiple <strong>-h</strong> flags.
  <p>Alternatively, if the <strong>-a</strong> option is used, the metrics are retrieved from the Performance Co-Pilot archive log files identified by <em>archive</em>, which is a comma-separated list of names, each of which may be the base name of an archive or the name of a directory containing one or more archives. Multiple sets of archives may be replayed by supplying multiple <strong>-a</strong> flags. When the <strong>-a</strong> flag is used, the <strong>-P</strong> flag may also be used to pause the output after each interval.
  <p>Standalone mode can only connect to the local host, using a set of archives implies a host name, and nominating a host precludes using an archive, so the options <strong>-L</strong>, <strong>-a</strong> and <strong>-h</strong> are mutually exclusive.
  <p>Normally <strong>pmstat</strong> operates on the default Performance Metrics Name Space (PMNS), however if the <strong>-n</strong> option is specified an alternative namespace is loaded from the file <em>pmnsfile</em>.
  <p>If the <strong>-s</strong> the option is specified, <em>samples</em> defines the number of samples to be retrieved and reported. If <em>samples</em> is 0 or <strong>-s</strong> is not specified, <strong>pmstat</strong> will sample and report continuously - this is the default behavior.
  <p>When processing a set of archives, <strong>pmstat</strong> may relinquish its own timing control, and operate as a ``slave'' of a <strong>pmtime</strong>(1) process that uses a GUI dialog to provide timing control. In this case, either the <strong>-g</strong> option should be used to start <strong>pmstat</strong> as the sole slave of a new <strong>pmtime</strong>(1) instance, or <strong>-p</strong> should be used to attach <strong>pmstat</strong> to an existing <strong>pmtime</strong>(1) instance via the IPC channel identified by the port argument.
  <p>The <strong>-S</strong>, <strong>-T</strong>, <strong>-O</strong> and <strong>-A</strong> options may be used to define a time window to restrict the samples retrieved, set an initial origin within the time window, or specify a ``natural'' alignment of the sample times; refer to <strong>PCPIntro</strong>(1) for a complete description of these options.
  <p>The <strong>-l</strong> option prints the last 7 characters of a hostname in summaries involving more than one host (when more than one <strong>-h</strong> option has been specified on the command line).
  <p>The <strong>-x</strong> option (extended CPU metrics) causes two additional CPU metrics to be reported, namely wait for I/O ("wa") and virtualisation steal time ("st").
  <p>The output from <strong>pmstat</strong> is directed to standard output, and the columns in the report are interpreted as follows:
  <dl class="indent-10">
    <dt><strong>loadavg</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>The <em>1 minute</em> load average.
    <dt><strong>memory</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>The <strong>swpd</strong> column indicates average swap space used during the interval, in Kbytes. The <strong>free</strong> column indicates average free memory during the interval, in Kbytes. The <strong>buff</strong> column indicates average buffer memory in use during the interval, in Kbytes. The <strong>cache</strong> column indicates average cached memory in use during the interval, in Kbytes.
      <p>If the values become large, they are reported as Mbytes (<strong>m</strong> suffix) or Gbytes (<strong>g</strong> suffix).
    <dt><strong>swap</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>The metrics in this area of the kernel instrumentation are of varying value. &nbsp;We try to report the average number of <strong>pages</strong> that are paged in (<strong>pi</strong>) and out (<strong>po</strong>) per second during the interval. If the corresponding page swapping metrics are unavailable, we report the average rate per second of swap <strong>operations</strong> in (<strong>si</strong>) and out (<strong>so</strong>) during the interval. It is normal for the ``in'' values to be non-zero, but the system is suffering memory stress if the ``out'' values are non-zero over an extended period.
      <p>If the values become large, they are reported as thousands of operations per second (<strong>K</strong> suffix) or millions of operations per second (<strong>M</strong> suffix).
    <dt><strong>io</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>The <strong>bi</strong> and <strong>bo</strong> columns indicate the average rate per second of block input and block output operations (respectfully) during the interval. Unless all file systems have a 1 Kbyte block size, these rates do not directly indicate Kbytes transferred.
      <p>If the values become large, they are reported as thousands of operations per second (<strong>K</strong> suffix) or millions of operations per second (<strong>M</strong> suffix).
    <dt><strong>system</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Interrupt rate (<strong>in</strong>) and context switch rate (<strong>cs</strong>). Rates are expressed as average operations per second during the interval. Note that the interrupt rate is normally at least <em>HZ</em> (the clock interrupt rate, usually 100) interrupts per second.
      <p>If the values become large, they are reported as thousands of operations per second (<strong>K</strong> suffix) or millions of operations per second (<strong>M</strong> suffix).
    <dt><strong>cpu</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Percentage of CPU time spent executing user and "nice user" code (<strong>us</strong>), system and interrupt processing code (<strong>sy</strong>), idle loop (<strong>id</strong>).
  </dl>
  <p>If any values for the associated performance metrics are unavailable, the value appears as ``?'' in the output.
  <p>By default, <strong>pmstat</strong> reports the time of day according to the local timezone on the system where <strong>pmstat</strong> is run. The <strong>-Z</strong> option changes the timezone to <em>timezone</em> in the format of the environment variable <strong>TZ</strong> as described in <strong>environ</strong>(7). The <strong>-z</strong> option changes the timezone to the local timezone at the host that is the source of the performance metrics, as identified via either the <strong>-h</strong> or <strong>-a</strong> options.

  <h2>PCP ENVIRONMENT</h2>
  <p>Environment variables with the prefix <strong>PCP_</strong> are used to parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP. On each installation, the file <em>/etc/pcp.conf</em> contains the local values for these variables. The <strong>$PCP_CONF</strong> variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration file, as described in <strong>pcp.conf</strong>(5).
