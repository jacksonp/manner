  <p>pdb2mdb - Program Database to Mono Debugging Symbol converter.

  <h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>
  <p><strong>pdb2mdb</strong> pdb_file

  <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
  <p>This tool is used to convert debugging symbols generated by Microsoft's compilers into debugging symbols that can be consumed by Mono's runtime.
  <p>Program Database files are files that end with the extension .pdb and are associated with a library or executable (a .dll or .exe file). This format was until recently not documented so Mono used its own file format for storing debugging information, the Mono debugging format. &nbsp;
  <p>Just like PDB files Mono Debugging information is stored in files that reside side-by-side with a program executable or a library.
  <p>You can use the pdb2mdb tool to transform these PDB files into MDB files that Mono can then consume to debug programs or provide line-number information for stack traces or exceptions.
