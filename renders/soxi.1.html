  <h2>NAME</h2>
  <p>SoXI - Sound eXchange Information, display sound file metadata
</section>
<section>
  <h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>
  <p><strong>soxi</strong> [<strong>-V</strong>[<em>level</em>]] [<strong>-T</strong>] [<strong>-t</strong>|<strong>-r</strong>|<strong>-c</strong>|<strong>-s</strong>|<strong>-d</strong>|<strong>-D</strong>|<strong>-b</strong>|<strong>-B</strong>|<strong>-p</strong>|<strong>-e</strong>|<strong>-a</strong>] <em>infile1</em> ...

  <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
  <p>Displays information from the header of a given audio file or files. Supported audio file types are listed and described in <strong>soxformat</strong>(7). Note however, that <strong>soxi</strong> is intended for use only with audio files with a self-describing header.
  <p>By default, as much information as is available is shown. An option may be given to select just a single piece of information (perhaps for use in a script or batch-file).

  <h2>OPTIONS</h2>
  <dl>
    <dt><strong>-V</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Set verbosity. See <strong>sox</strong>(1) for details.
    <dt><strong>-T</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Used with multiple files; changes the behaviour of <strong>-s</strong>, <strong>-d</strong> and <strong>-D</strong> to display the total across all given files. Note that when used with <strong>-s</strong> with files with different sampling rates, this is of questionable value.
    <dt><strong>-t</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Show detected file-type.
    <dt><strong>-r</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Show sample-rate.
    <dt><strong>-c</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Show number of channels.
    <dt><strong>-s</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Show number of samples (0 if unavailable).
    <dt><strong>-d</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Show duration in hours, minutes and seconds (0 if unavailable). Equivalent to number of samples divided by the sample-rate.
    <dt><strong>-D</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Show duration in seconds (0 if unavailable).
    <dt><strong>-b</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Show number of bits per sample (0 if not applicable).
    <dt><strong>-B</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Show the bitrate averaged over the whole file (0 if unavailable).
    <dt><strong>-p</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Show estimated sample precision in bits.
    <dt><strong>-e</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Show the name of the audio encoding.
    <dt><strong>-a</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Show file comments (annotations) if available.
