  <h2>NAME</h2>
  <p><strong>pmlogmv</strong> - move (rename) Performance Co-Pilot archive files
</div>
<div class="section">
  <h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>
  <p><strong>pmlogmv</strong> [<em>-NV</em>] <em>oldname</em> <em>newname</em>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
  <p>A Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) archive consists of multiple files as created by <a href="/1/pmlogger" class="link-man">pmlogger(1)</a>. <strong>pmlogmv</strong> allows all the files of a single PCP archive to be moved or renamed as a group in a single operation.
  <p>The <em>oldname</em> argument identifies the target archive, and may be either the basename that is common to all files in that archive or one of the archive's files. The new archive's basename is <em>newname</em>.
  <p>The <strong>-N</strong> option performs a dry-run, checking and reporting what changes would be made without making any changes.
  <p>Additional reporting verbosity may be requested with the <strong>-V</strong> option.
  <p>Because PCP archives are important records of system activity, special care is taken to ensure the integrity of an archive's files. For recoverable problems encountered during the execution of <strong>pmlogmv</strong>, all the files associated with <em>oldname</em> will be preserved, and no new files with the <em>newname</em> prefix will be created. ``Recoverable problems'' include signals that can be caught (such as SIGHUP, SIGINT, SIGQUIT and SIGTERM), permissions issues, new files already existing, file system full events, etc.
  <p>The implementation of <strong>pmlogmv</strong> uses hard links in the file system and so follows the semantic restrictions of <em>ln</em>(2) which for most systems means the directories containing both the <em>oldname</em> and the <em>newname</em> PCP archive files need to be writeable and within the <strong>same</strong> file system.
