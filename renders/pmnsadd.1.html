<h1>PMNSADD</h1>
<div class="section">
  <h2>NAME</h2>
  <p><strong>pmnsadd</strong> - add new names to the Performance Co-Pilot PMNS
</div>
<div class="section">
  <h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>
  <p><strong>$PCP_BINADM_DIR/pmnsadd</strong> [<strong>-n</strong> <em>namespace</em>] <em>file</em>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
  <p><strong>pmnsmerge</strong>(1) performs the same function as <strong>pmnsadd</strong> and is faster, more robust and more flexible. It is therefore recommended that <strong>pmnsmerge</strong>(1) be used instead.
  <p><strong>pmnsadd</strong> adds subtree(s) of new names into a Performance Metrics Name Space (PMNS), as used by the components of the Performance Co-Pilot (PCP).
  <p>Normally <strong>pmnsadd</strong> operates on the default Performance Metrics Name Space (PMNS), however if the <strong>-n</strong> option is specified an alternative namespace is used from the file <em>namespace</em>.
  <p>The default PMNS is found in the file <em>$PCP_VAR_DIR/pmns/root</em> unless the environment variable <strong>PMNS_DEFAULT</strong> is set, in which case the value is assumed to be the pathname to the file containing the default PMNS.
  <p>The new names are specified in the <em>file</em>, arguments and conform to the syntax for PMNS specifications, see <strong>pmns</strong>(5). There is one PMNS subtree in each <em>file</em>, and the base PMNS pathname to the inserted subtree is identified by the first group named in each <em>file</em>, e.g. if the specifications begin
  <pre>myagent.foo.stuff {
    mumble      123:45:1
    fumble      123:45:2
}</pre>
  <p>then the new names will be added into the PMNS at the non-leaf position identified by <code>myagent.foo.stuff</code>, and following all other names with the prefix <code>myagent.foo</code>.
  <p>The new names must be contained within a single subtree of the namespace. If disjoint subtrees need to be added, these must be packaged into separate files and <strong>pmnsadd</strong> used on each, one at a time.
  <p>All of the files defining the PMNS must be located within the directory that contains the root of the PMNS, this would typically be <strong>$PCP_VAR_DIR/pmns</strong> for the default PMNS, and this would typically imply running <strong>pmnsadd</strong> as root.
  <p>As a special case, if <em>file</em> contains a line that begins <code>root {</code> then it is assumed to be a complete PMNS that needs to be merged, so none of the subtree extraction and rewriting is performed and <em>file</em> is handed directly to <strong>pmnsmerge</strong>(1).
  <p>Provided some initial integrity checks are satisfied, <strong>pmnsadd</strong> will update the PMNS using <strong>pmnsmerge</strong>(1) - if this fails for any reason, the original namespace remains unchanged.

  <h2>CAVEAT</h2>
  <p>Once the writing of the new <em>namespace</em> file has begun, the signals SIGINT, SIGHUP and SIGTERM will be ignored to protect the integrity of the new files.

  <h2>FILES</h2>
  <dl class="indent-2.5i">
    <dt><em>$PCP_VAR_DIR/pmns/root</em>

<div class="section">
  <h2>PCP ENVIRONMENT</h2>
  <p>Environment variables with the prefix <strong>PCP_</strong> are used to parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP. On each installation, the file <em>/etc/pcp.conf</em> contains the local values for these variables. The <strong>$PCP_CONF</strong> variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration file, as described in <strong>pcp.conf</strong>(5).
