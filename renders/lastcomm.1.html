  <h2>NAME</h2>
  <p>lastcomm - &nbsp;print out information about previously executed commands.
</section>
<section>
  <h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>
  <dl>
    <dt><strong>lastcomm</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>[ <em>command-name ...</em> ]<br>
      [ <em>user-name ...</em> ]<br>
      [ <em>terminal-name ...</em> ]<br>
      [ OPTION ... ]
  </dl>
</section>

  <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
  <p><strong>lastcomm</strong> prints out information about previously executed commands. &nbsp;If no arguments are specified, <strong>lastcomm</strong> will print info about all of the commands in <em>acct</em> (the record file). &nbsp;If called with one or more of <em>command-name,</em> <em>user-name,</em> or <em>terminal-name,</em> only records containing those items will be displayed. &nbsp;For &nbsp;example, to find out which users used command `a.out' &nbsp;and which users were logged into `tty0', type:
  <p class="center">lastcomm a.out tty0
  <p>This will print any entry for which `a.out' or `tty0' &nbsp;matches in any of the record's fields (command, name, or terminal). &nbsp;If &nbsp;you want to find only items that match *all* of the arguments on the command &nbsp;line, you must use the '-strict-match' option. &nbsp;For example, to list &nbsp;all of the executions of command <em>a.out</em> by user <em>root</em> on terminal <em>tty0,</em> type:
  <p class="center">lastcomm --strict-match --command a.out --user root --tty tty0
  <p>The order of the arguments is not important.
  <p>For each entry the following information is printed:<br>
  &nbsp; + command name of the process<br>
  &nbsp; + flags, as recorded by the system accounting routines:<br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;S -- command executed by super-user<br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;F -- command executed after a fork but without a following exec<br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;C -- command run in PDP-11 compatibility mode (VAX only)<br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;D -- command terminated with the generation of a core file<br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;X -- command was terminated with the signal SIGTERM<br>
  &nbsp; + the name of the user who ran the process<br>
  &nbsp; + time the process exited

  <h2>OPTIONS</h2>
  <dl>
    <dt><strong>--strict-match</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Print only entries that match *all* of the arguments on the command line.
    <dt><strong>--print-controls</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Print control characters.
    <dt><strong>--user</strong> <em>name</em>
    <dd>
      <p>List records for user with <em>name.</em> This is useful if you're trying to match a username that happens to be the same as a command (e.g., <em>ed</em> ).
    <dt><strong>--command</strong> <em>name</em>
    <dd>
      <p>List records for command <em>name.</em>
    <dt><strong>--tty</strong> <em>name</em>
    <dd>
      <p>List records for tty <em>name.</em>
    <dt><strong>--forwards</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Read file forwards instead of backwards. This avoids trying to seek on the file and can be used to read from a pipe. This must be specified prior to any <strong>-f</strong> arguments.
    <dt><strong>-f</strong> <em>filename,</em> <strong>--file</strong> <em>filename</em>
    <dd>
      <p>Read from the file <em>filename</em> instead of <em>acct.</em> A filename of "-" will result in reading from stdin. This must either be the first <strong>-f</strong> option, or <strong>--forwards</strong> must precede all <strong>-f</strong> options.
    <dt><strong>--ahz</strong> <em>hz</em>
    <dd>
      <p>Use this flag to tell the program what <strong>AHZ</strong> should be (in hertz). &nbsp;This option is useful if you are trying to view an <em>acct</em> file created on another machine which has the same byte order and file format as your current machine, but has a different value for <strong>AHZ.</strong>
    <dt><strong>-p, --show-paging</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Print paging statistics
    <dt><strong>--debug</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Print verbose internal information.
    <dt><strong>-V, --version</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Print the version number of <strong>lastcomm.</strong>
    <dt><strong>-h, --help</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Prints the usage string and default locations of system files to standard output and exits.
