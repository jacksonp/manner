<h1>LASTCOMM</h1>
<section>
  <h2>NAME</h2>
  <p>lastcomm - print out information about previously executed commands.
</section>
<section>
  <h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>
  <dl>
    <dt><strong>lastcomm</strong>
    <dd>[ <em>command-name ...</em> ]<br>
    [ <em>user-name ...</em> ]<br>
    [ <em>terminal-name ...</em> ]<br>
    [ OPTION ... ]
  </dl>
</section>

  <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
  <p><strong>lastcomm</strong> prints out information about previously executed commands. If no arguments are specified, <strong>lastcomm</strong> will print info about all of the commands in <em>acct</em> (the record file). If called with one or more of <em>command-name,</em> <em>user-name,</em> or <em>terminal-name,</em> only records containing those items will be displayed. For example, to find out which users used command `a.out' and which users were logged into `tty0', type:
  <div class="center">
    <p>lastcomm a.out tty0
  </div>
  <p>This will print any entry for which `a.out' or `tty0' matches in any of the record's fields (command, name, or terminal). If you want to find only items that match *all* of the arguments on the command line, you must use the '-strict-match' option. For example, to list all of the executions of command <em>a.out</em> by user <em>root</em> on terminal <em>tty0,</em> type:
  <div class="center">
    <p>lastcomm --strict-match --command a.out --user root --tty tty0
  </div>
  <p>The order of the arguments is not important.
  <p>For each entry the following information is printed:<br>
  + command name of the process<br>
  + flags, as recorded by the system accounting routines:<br>
  S -- command executed by super-user<br>
  F -- command executed after a fork but without a following exec<br>
  C -- command run in PDP-11 compatibility mode (VAX only)<br>
  D -- command terminated with the generation of a core file<br>
  X -- command was terminated with the signal SIGTERM<br>
  + the name of the user who ran the process<br>
  + time the process exited

  <h2>OPTIONS</h2>
  <dl>
    <dt><strong>--strict-match</strong>
    <dd>Print only entries that match *all* of the arguments on the command line.
    <dt><strong>--print-controls</strong>
    <dd>Print control characters.
    <dt><strong>--user</strong> <em>name</em>
    <dd>List records for user with <em>name.</em> This is useful if you're trying to match a username that happens to be the same as a command (e.g., <em>ed</em> ).
    <dt><strong>--command</strong> <em>name</em>
    <dd>List records for command <em>name.</em>
    <dt><strong>--tty</strong> <em>name</em>
    <dd>List records for tty <em>name.</em>
    <dt><strong>--forwards</strong>
    <dd>Read file forwards instead of backwards. This avoids trying to seek on the file and can be used to read from a pipe. This must be specified prior to any <strong>-f</strong> arguments.
    <dt><strong>-f</strong> <em>filename,</em> <strong>--file</strong> <em>filename</em>
    <dd>Read from the file <em>filename</em> instead of <em>acct.</em> A filename of "-" will result in reading from stdin. This must either be the first <strong>-f</strong> option, or <strong>--forwards</strong> must precede all <strong>-f</strong> options.
    <dt><strong>--ahz</strong> <em>hz</em>
    <dd>Use this flag to tell the program what <strong>AHZ</strong> should be (in hertz). This option is useful if you are trying to view an <em>acct</em> file created on another machine which has the same byte order and file format as your current machine, but has a different value for <strong>AHZ.</strong>
    <dt><strong>-p, --show-paging</strong>
    <dd>Print paging statistics
    <dt><strong>--debug</strong>
    <dd>Print verbose internal information.
    <dt><strong>-V, --version</strong>
    <dd>Print the version number of <strong>lastcomm.</strong>
    <dt><strong>-h, --help</strong>
    <dd>Prints the usage string and default locations of system files to standard output and exits.
