<h1>SCRIPTREPLAY</h1>
<div class="section">
  <h2>NAME</h2>
  <p>scriptreplay - play back typescripts, using timing information
</div>
<div class="section">
  <h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>
  <p><strong>scriptreplay</strong> [options] [<strong>-t</strong>] <em>timingfile</em> [<em>typescript</em> [<em>divisor</em>]]
</div>
<div class="section">
  <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
  <p>This program replays a typescript, using timing information to ensure that output happens in the same rhythm as it originally appeared when the script was recorded.
  <p>The replay simply displays the information again; the programs that were run when the typescript was being recorded are not run again. Since the same information is simply being displayed, <strong>scriptreplay</strong> is only guaranteed to work properly if run on the same type of terminal the typescript was recorded on. Otherwise, any escape characters in the typescript may be interpreted differently by the terminal to which <strong>scriptreplay</strong> is sending its output.
  <p>The timing information is what <strong>script</strong>(1) outputs to standard error if it is run with the <strong>-t</strong> parameter.
  <p>By default, the typescript to display is assumed to be named <strong>typescript</strong>, but other filenames may be specified, as the second parameter or with option <strong>-s</strong>.
  <p>If the third parameter is specified, it is used as a speed-up multiplier. For example, a speed-up of 2 makes <strong>scriptreplay</strong> go twice as fast, and a speed-up of 0.1 makes it go ten times slower than the original session.

  <h2>OPTIONS</h2>
  <p>The first three options will override old-style arguments.
  <dl>
    <dt><strong>-t</strong>, <strong>--timing</strong> <em>file</em>
    <dd>
      <p>File containing <strong>script</strong>'s timing output.
    <dt><strong>-s</strong>, <strong>--typescript</strong> <em>file</em>
    <dd>
      <p>File containing <strong>script</strong>'s terminal output.
    <dt><strong>-d</strong>, <strong>--divisor</strong> <em>number</em>
    <dd>
      <p>Speed up the replay displaying this <em>number</em> of times. The argument is a floating point number. It's called divisor because it divides the timings by this factor.
    <dt><strong>-m</strong>, <strong>--maxdelay</strong> <em>number</em>
    <dd>
      <p>Set the maximum delay between transcript updates to <em>number</em> of seconds. The argument is a floating point number. This can be used to avoid long pauses in the transcript replay.
    <dt><strong>-V</strong>, <strong>--version</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Display version information and exit.
    <dt><strong>-h</strong>, <strong>--help</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Display help text and exit.
  </dl>
