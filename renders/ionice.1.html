  <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
  <p>This program sets or gets the I/O scheduling class and priority for a program. If no arguments or just <strong>-p</strong> is given, <strong>ionice</strong> will query the current I/O scheduling class and priority for that process.
  <p>When <em>command</em> is given, <strong>ionice</strong> will run this command with the given arguments. If no <em>class</em> is specified, then <em>command</em> will be executed with the "best-effort" scheduling class. &nbsp;The default priority level is 4.
  <p>As of this writing, a process can be in one of three scheduling classes:
  <dl>
    <dt><strong>Idle</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>A program running with idle I/O priority will only get disk time when no other program has asked for disk I/O for a defined grace period. &nbsp;The impact of an idle I/O process on normal system activity should be zero. &nbsp;This scheduling class does not take a priority argument. &nbsp;Presently, this scheduling class is permitted for an ordinary user (since kernel 2.6.25).
    <dt><strong>Best-effort</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>This is the effective scheduling class for any process that has not asked for a specific I/O priority. This class takes a priority argument from <em>0-7</em>, with a lower number being higher priority. &nbsp;Programs running at the same best-effort priority are served in a round-robin fashion.
      <p>Note that before kernel 2.6.26 a process that has not asked for an I/O priority formally uses "<strong>none</strong>" as scheduling class, but the I/O scheduler will treat such processes as if it were in the best-effort class. &nbsp;The priority within the best-effort class will be dynamically derived from the CPU nice level of the process: io_priority = (cpu_nice + 20) / 5.
      <p>For kernels after 2.6.26 with the CFQ I/O scheduler, a process that has not asked for an I/O priority inherits its CPU scheduling class. &nbsp;The I/O priority is derived from the CPU nice level of the process (same as before kernel 2.6.26).
    <dt><strong>Realtime</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>The RT scheduling class is given first access to the disk, regardless of what else is going on in the system. &nbsp;Thus the RT class needs to be used with some care, as it can starve other processes. &nbsp;As with the best-effort class, 8 priority levels are defined denoting how big a time slice a given process will receive on each scheduling window. &nbsp;This scheduling class is not permitted for an ordinary (i.e., non-root) user.

  <h2>OPTIONS</h2>
  <dl>
    <dt><strong>-c</strong>, <strong>--class</strong> <em>class</em>
    <dd>
      <p>Specify the name or number of the scheduling class to use; <em>0</em> for none, <em>1</em> for realtime, <em>2</em> for best-effort, <em>3</em> for idle.
    <dt><strong>-n</strong>, <strong>--classdata</strong> <em>level</em>
    <dd>
      <p>Specify the scheduling class data. &nbsp;This only has an effect if the class accepts an argument. &nbsp;For realtime and best-effort, <em>0-7</em> are valid data (priority levels), and <em>0</em> represents the highest priority level.
    <dt><strong>-p</strong>, <strong>--pid</strong> <em>PID</em>...
    <dd>
      <p>Specify the process IDs of running processes for which to get or set the scheduling parameters.
    <dt><strong>-P</strong>, <strong>--pgid</strong> <em>PGID</em>...
    <dd>
      <p>Specify the process group IDs of running processes for which to get or set the scheduling parameters.
    <dt><strong>-t</strong>, <strong>--ignore</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Ignore failure to set the requested priority. &nbsp;If <em>command</em> was specified, run it even in case it was not possible to set the desired scheduling priority, which can happen due to insufficient privileges or an old kernel version.
    <dt><strong>-h</strong>, <strong>--help</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Display help text and exit.
    <dt><strong>-u</strong>, <strong>--uid</strong> <em>UID</em>...
    <dd>
      <p>Specify the user IDs of running processes for which to get or set the scheduling parameters.
    <dt><strong>-V</strong>, <strong>--version</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Display version information and exit.
  </dl>

  <h2>EXAMPLES</h2>
  <p># <strong>ionice</strong> -c 3 -p 89
  <p>Sets process with PID 89 as an idle I/O process.
  <p># <strong>ionice</strong> -c 2 -n 0 bash
  <p>Runs 'bash' as a best-effort program with highest priority.
  <p># <strong>ionice</strong> -p 89 91
  <p>Prints the class and priority of the processes with PID 89 and 91.

  <h2>NOTES</h2>
  <p>Linux supports I/O scheduling priorities and classes since 2.6.13 with the CFQ I/O scheduler.
