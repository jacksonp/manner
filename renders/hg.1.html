  <h2>COMMANDS</h2>
  <div class="subsection">
    <h3>add</h3>
    <p>add the specified files on the next commit:<br>
    <br>
    <pre> hg add [OPTION]... [FILE]...
</pre>
    <p>Schedule files to be version controlled and added to the repository.<br>
    <br>
    The files will be added to the repository at the next commit. To undo an add before that, see <strong>hg forget</strong>.<br>
    <br>
    If no names are given, add all files to the repository (except files matching <strong>.hgignore</strong>).<br>
    <br>
    Examples:
    <dl class="indent-2">
      <dt>·
      <dd>
        <p>New (unknown) files are added automatically by <strong>hg add</strong>:<br>
        <br>
        <pre> $ ls
 foo.c
 $ hg status
 ? foo.c
 $ hg add
 adding foo.c
 $ hg status
 A foo.c
</pre>
      <dt>·

 $ hg status
 ? bar.c
 ? foo.c
 $ hg add bar.c
 $ hg status
 A bar.c
 ? foo.c
</pre>
        <p>Returns 0 if all files are successfully added.<br>
        <br>
        Options:

    <h3>addremove</h3>
    <p>add all new files, delete all missing files:<br>
    <br>
    <pre> hg addremove [OPTION]... [FILE]...
</pre>
    <p>Add all new files and remove all missing files from the repository.<br>
    <br>
    Unless names are given, new files are ignored if they match any of the patterns in <strong>.hgignore</strong>. As with add, these changes take effect at the next commit.<br>
    <br>
    Use the -s/--similarity option to detect renamed files. This option takes a percentage between 0 (disabled) and 100 (files must be identical) as its parameter. With a parameter greater than 0, this compares every removed file with every added file and records those similar enough as renames. Detecting renamed files this way can be expensive. After using this option, <strong>hg status -C</strong> can be used to check which files were identified as moved or renamed. If not specified, -s/--similarity defaults to 100 and only renames of identical files are detected.<br>
    <br>
    Examples:
    <dl class="indent-2">
      <dt>·
      <dd>
        <p>A number of files (bar.c and foo.c) are new, while foobar.c has been removed (without using <strong>hg remove</strong>) from the repository:<br>
        <br>
        <pre> $ ls
 bar.c foo.c
 $ hg status
 ! foobar.c
 ? bar.c
 ? foo.c
 $ hg addremove
 adding bar.c
 adding foo.c
 removing foobar.c
 $ hg status
 A bar.c
 A foo.c
 R foobar.c
</pre>
      <dt>·
      <dd>
        <p>A file foobar.c was moved to foo.c without using <strong>hg rename</strong>. Afterwards, it was edited slightly:<br>
        <br>
        <pre> $ ls
 foo.c
 $ hg status
 ! foobar.c
 ? foo.c
 $ hg addremove --similarity 90
 removing foobar.c
 adding foo.c
 recording removal of foobar.c as rename to foo.c (94% similar)
 $ hg status -C
 A foo.c
   foobar.c
 R foobar.c
</pre>
        <p>Returns 0 if all files are successfully added.<br>
        <br>
        Options:
      <dt><strong>-s,</strong><em>--similarity</em><strong>&nbsp;&lt;SIMILARITY&gt;</strong>

    <h3>annotate</h3>
    <p>show changeset information by line for each file:<br>
    <br>
    <pre> hg annotate [-r REV] [-f] [-a] [-u] [-d] [-n] [-c] [-l] FILE...
</pre>
    <p>List changes in files, showing the revision id responsible for each line.<br>
    <br>
    This command is useful for discovering when a change was made and by whom.<br>
    <br>
    If you include --file, --user, or --date, the revision number is suppressed unless you also include --number.<br>
    <br>
    Without the -a/--text option, annotate will avoid processing files it detects as binary. With -a, annotate will annotate the file anyway, although the results will probably be neither useful nor desirable.<br>
    <br>
    Returns 0 on success.<br>

    <h3>archive</h3>
    <p>create an unversioned archive of a repository revision:<br>
    <br>
    <pre> hg archive [OPTION]... DEST
</pre>
    <p>By default, the revision used is the parent of the working directory; use -r/--rev to specify a different revision.<br>

    <h3>backout</h3>
    <p>reverse effect of earlier changeset:<br>
    <br>
    <pre> hg backout [OPTION]... [-r] REV
</pre>
    <p>Prepare a new changeset with the effect of REV undone in the current working directory. If no conflicts were encountered, it will be committed immediately.<br>
    <br>
    If REV is the parent of the working directory, then this new changeset is committed automatically (unless --no-commit is specified).
    <dl class="indent-2">
      <dt>Note
      <dd>
        <p><strong>hg backout</strong> cannot be used to fix either an unwanted or incorrect merge.<br>
        <br>
        Examples:
      <dt>·
      <dd>
        <p>Reverse the effect of the parent of the working directory. This backout will be committed immediately:<br>
        <br>
        <pre> hg backout -r .
</pre>
      <dt>·
      <dd>
        <p>Reverse the effect of previous bad revision 23:<br>
        <br>
        <pre> hg backout -r 23

        <br>
        <pre> hg backout -r 23 --no-commit
 hg commit -m "Backout revision 23"
</pre>
        <p>By default, the pending changeset will have one parent, maintaining a linear history. With --merge, the pending changeset will instead have two parents: the old parent of the working directory and a new child of REV that simply undoes REV.<br>
        <br>
        Before version 1.7, the behavior without --merge was equivalent to specifying --merge followed by <strong>hg update --clean .</strong> to cancel the merge and leave the child of REV as a head to be merged separately.<br>
        <br>
        See <strong>hg help dates</strong> for a list of formats valid for -d/--date.<br>
        <br>
        See <strong>hg help revert</strong> for a way to restore files to the state of another revision.<br>
        <br>
        Returns 0 on success, 1 if nothing to backout or there are unresolved files.<br>
        <br>
        Options:

    <h3>bisect</h3>
    <p>subdivision search of changesets:<br>
    <br>
    <pre> hg bisect [-gbsr] [-U] [-c CMD] [REV]
</pre>
    <p>This command helps to find changesets which introduce problems. To use, mark the earliest changeset you know exhibits the problem as bad, then mark the latest changeset which is free from the problem as good. Bisect will update your working directory to a revision for testing (unless the -U/--noupdate option is specified). Once you have performed tests, mark the working directory as good or bad, and bisect will either update to another candidate changeset or announce that it has found the bad revision.<br>
    <br>
    As a shortcut, you can also use the revision argument to mark a revision as good or bad without checking it out first.<br>
    <br>
    If you supply a command, it will be used for automatic bisection. The environment variable HG_NODE will contain the ID of the changeset being tested. The exit status of the command will be used to mark revisions as good or bad: status 0 means good, 125 means to skip the revision, 127 (command not found) will abort the bisection, and any other non-zero exit status means the revision is bad.<br>
    <br>
    Some examples:
    <dl class="indent-2">
      <dt>·
      <dd>
        <p>start a bisection with known bad revision 34, and good revision 12:<br>

        <pre> hg bisect --bad 34
 hg bisect --good 12
</pre>
      <dt>·
      <dd>
        <p>advance the current bisection by marking current revision as good or bad:<br>
        <br>
        <pre> hg bisect --good
 hg bisect --bad
</pre>
      <dt>·
      <dd>
        <p>mark the current revision, or a known revision, to be skipped (e.g. if that revision is not usable because of another issue):<br>
        <br>
        <pre> hg bisect --skip
 hg bisect --skip 23
</pre>
      <dt>·

</pre>
      <dt>·
      <dd>
        <p>see the changeset currently being bisected (especially useful if running with -U/--noupdate):<br>
        <br>
        <pre> hg log -r "bisect(current)"
</pre>
      <dt>·

    <h3>bookmarks</h3>
    <p>create a new bookmark or list existing bookmarks:<br>
    <br>
    <pre> hg bookmarks [OPTIONS]... [NAME]...
</pre>
    <p>Bookmarks are labels on changesets to help track lines of development. Bookmarks are unversioned and can be moved, renamed and deleted. Deleting or moving a bookmark has no effect on the associated changesets.<br>
    <br>
    Creating or updating to a bookmark causes it to be marked as 'active'. The active bookmark is indicated with a '*'. When a commit is made, the active bookmark will advance to the new commit. A plain <strong>hg update</strong> will also advance an active bookmark, if possible. Updating away from a bookmark will cause it to be deactivated.<br>
    <br>
    Bookmarks can be pushed and pulled between repositories (see <strong>hg help push</strong> and <strong>hg help pull</strong>). If a shared bookmark has diverged, a new 'divergent bookmark' of the form 'name@path' will be created. Using <strong>hg merge</strong> will resolve the divergence.<br>
    <br>
    A bookmark named '@' has the special property that <strong>hg clone</strong> will check it out by default if it exists.<br>
    <br>
    Examples:
    <dl class="indent-2">

      <dt>Note

        <p>Branch names are permanent and global. Use <strong>hg bookmark</strong> to create a light-weight bookmark instead. See <strong>hg help glossary</strong> for more information about named branches and bookmarks.<br>
        <br>
        With no argument, show the current branch name. With one argument, set the working directory branch name (the branch will not exist in the repository until the next commit). Standard practice recommends that primary development take place on the 'default' branch.<br>
        <br>
        Unless -f/--force is specified, branch will not let you set a branch name that already exists.<br>
        <br>
        Use -C/--clean to reset the working directory branch to that of the parent of the working directory, negating a previous branch change.<br>
        <br>
        Use the command <strong>hg update</strong> to switch to an existing branch. Use <strong>hg commit --close-branch</strong> to mark this branch head as closed. When all heads of a branch are closed, the branch will be considered closed.<br>

</pre>
    <p>Generate a changegroup file collecting changesets to be added to a repository.<br>
    <br>
    To create a bundle containing all changesets, use -a/--all (or --base null). Otherwise, hg assumes the destination will have all the nodes you specify with --base parameters. Otherwise, hg will assume the repository has all the nodes in destination, or default-push/default if no destination is specified.<br>
    <br>
    You can change bundle format with the -t/--type option. You can specify a compression, a bundle version or both using a dash (comp-version). The available compression methods are: none, bzip2, and gzip (by default, bundles are compressed using bzip2). The available formats are: v1, v2 (default to most suitable).<br>
    <br>
    The bundle file can then be transferred using conventional means and applied to another repository with the unbundle or pull command. This is useful when direct push and pull are not available or when exporting an entire repository is undesirable.<br>
    <br>
    Applying bundles preserves all changeset contents including permissions, copy/rename information, and revision history.<br>

    <h3>clone</h3>
    <p>make a copy of an existing repository:<br>
    <br>
    <pre> hg clone [OPTION]... SOURCE [DEST]
</pre>
    <p>Create a copy of an existing repository in a new directory.<br>
    <br>
    If no destination directory name is specified, it defaults to the basename of the source.<br>
    <br>
    The location of the source is added to the new repository's <strong>.hg/hgrc</strong> file, as the default to be used for future pulls.<br>
    <br>
    Only local paths and <strong>ssh://</strong> URLs are supported as destinations. For <strong>ssh://</strong> destinations, no working directory or <strong>.hg/hgrc</strong> will be created on the remote side.<br>
    <br>
    If the source repository has a bookmark called '@' set, that revision will be checked out in the new repository by default.<br>
    <br>
    To check out a particular version, use -u/--update, or -U/--noupdate to create a clone with no working directory.<br>
    <br>
    To pull only a subset of changesets, specify one or more revisions identifiers with -r/--rev or branches with -b/--branch. The resulting clone will contain only the specified changesets and their ancestors. These options (or 'clone src#rev dest') imply --pull, even for local source repositories.
    <dl class="indent-3">
      <dt>Note
      <dd>
        <p>Specifying a tag will include the tagged changeset but not the changeset containing the tag.<br>
        <br>
        For efficiency, hardlinks are used for cloning whenever the source and destination are on the same filesystem (note this applies only to the repository data, not to the working directory). Some filesystems, such as AFS, implement hardlinking incorrectly, but do not report errors. In these cases, use the --pull option to avoid hardlinking.<br>
        <br>
        In some cases, you can clone repositories and the working directory using full hardlinks with<br>
        <br>
        <pre> $ cp -al REPO REPOCLONE
</pre>
        <p>This is the fastest way to clone, but it is not always safe. The operation is not atomic (making sure REPO is not modified during the operation is up to you) and you have to make sure your editor breaks hardlinks (Emacs and most Linux Kernel tools do so). Also, this is not compatible with certain extensions that place their metadata under the .hg directory, such as mq.<br>
        <br>
        Mercurial will update the working directory to the first applicable revision from this list:
      <dt>a.
      <dd>
        <p>null if -U or the source repository has no changesets
      <dt>b.
      <dd>
        <p>if -u . and the source repository is local, the first parent of the source repository's working directory
      <dt>c.
      <dd>
        <p>the changeset specified with -u (if a branch name, this means the latest head of that branch)
      <dt>d.
      <dd>
        <p>the changeset specified with -r
      <dt>e.
      <dd>
        <p>the tipmost head specified with -b
      <dt>f.
      <dd>
        <p>the tipmost head specified with the url#branch source syntax
      <dt>g.
      <dd>
        <p>the revision marked with the '@' bookmark, if present
      <dt>h.
      <dd>
        <p>the tipmost head of the default branch
      <dt>i.
      <dd>
        <p>tip<br>
        <br>
        When cloning from servers that support it, Mercurial may fetch pre-generated data from a server-advertised URL. When this is done, hooks operating on incoming changesets and changegroups may fire twice, once for the bundle fetched from the URL and another for any additional data not fetched from this URL. In addition, if an error occurs, the repository may be rolled back to a partial clone. This behavior may change in future releases. See <strong>hg help -e clonebundles</strong> for more.<br>

    The --amend flag can be used to amend the parent of the working directory with a new commit that contains the changes in the parent in addition to those currently reported by <strong>hg status</strong>, if there are any.

        <p><strong>hg diff</strong> may generate unexpected results for merges, as it will default to comparing against the working directory's first parent changeset if no revisions are specified.<br>
        <br>
        When two revision arguments are given, then changes are shown between those revisions. If only one revision is specified then that revision is compared to the working directory, and, when no revisions are specified, the working directory files are compared to its first parent.<br>
        <br>
        Alternatively you can specify -c/--change with a revision to see the changes in that changeset relative to its first parent.<br>
        <br>
        Without the -a/--text option, diff will avoid generating diffs of files it detects as binary. With -a, diff will generate a diff anyway, probably with undesirable results.<br>
        <br>
        Use the -g/--git option to generate diffs in the git extended diff format. For more information, read <strong>hg help diffs</strong>.<br>

    <p>copy changes from other branches onto the current branch:<br>

    <pre> hg graft [OPTION]... [-r REV]... REV...

    <p>This command uses Mercurial's merge logic to copy individual changes from other branches without merging branches in the history graph. This is sometimes known as 'backporting' or 'cherry-picking'. By default, graft will copy user, date, and description from the source changesets.<br>
    <br>
    Changesets that are ancestors of the current revision, that have already been grafted, or that are merges will be skipped.<br>
    <br>
    If --log is specified, log messages will have a comment appended of the form:<br>
    <br>
    <pre> (grafted from CHANGESETHASH)
</pre>
    <p>If --force is specified, revisions will be grafted even if they are already ancestors of or have been grafted to the destination. This is useful when the revisions have since been backed out.<br>
    <br>
    If a graft merge results in conflicts, the graft process is interrupted so that the current merge can be manually resolved. Once all conflicts are addressed, the graft process can be continued with the -c/--continue option.

    <br>
    This command behaves differently than Unix grep. It only accepts Python/Perl regexps. It searches repository history, not the working directory. It always prints the revision number in which a match appears.<br>
    <br>
    By default, grep only prints output for the first revision of a file in which it finds a match. To get it to print every revision that contains a change in match status (“-” for a match that becomes a non-match, or “+” for a non-match that becomes a match), use the --all flag.<br>
    <br>
    Returns 0 if a match is found, 1 otherwise.<br>

    <p>With no arguments, show all open branch heads in the repository. Branch heads are changesets that have no descendants on the same branch. They are where development generally takes place and are the usual targets for update and merge operations.<br>
    <br>
    If one or more REVs are given, only open branch heads on the branches associated with the specified changesets are shown. This means that you can use <strong>hg heads .</strong> to see the heads on the currently checked-out branch.<br>

    If -c/--closed is specified, also show branch heads marked closed (see <strong>hg commit --close-branch</strong>).<br>
    <br>
    If STARTREV is specified, only those heads that are descendants of STARTREV will be displayed.<br>
    <br>
    If -t/--topo is specified, named branch mechanics will be ignored and only topological heads (changesets with no children) will be shown.<br>

    <h3>import</h3>
    <p>import an ordered set of patches:<br>
    <br>
    <pre> hg import [OPTION]... PATCH...
</pre>
    <p>Import a list of patches and commit them individually (unless --no-commit is specified).<br>
    <br>
    To read a patch from standard input, use “-” as the patch name. If a URL is specified, the patch will be downloaded from there.<br>
    <br>
    Import first applies changes to the working directory (unless --bypass is specified), import will abort if there are outstanding changes.<br>
    <br>
    Use --bypass to apply and commit patches directly to the repository, without affecting the working directory. Without --exact, patches will be applied on top of the working directory parent revision.<br>
    <br>
    You can import a patch straight from a mail message. Even patches as attachments work (to use the body part, it must have type text/plain or text/x-patch). From and Subject headers of email message are used as default committer and commit message. All text/plain body parts before first diff are added to the commit message.<br>
    <br>
    If the imported patch was generated by <strong>hg export</strong>, user and description from patch override values from message headers and body. Values given on command line with -m/--message and -u/--user override these.<br>
    <br>
    If --exact is specified, import will set the working directory to the parent of each patch before applying it, and will abort if the resulting changeset has a different ID than the one recorded in the patch. This will guard against various ways that portable patch formats and mail systems might fail to transfer Mercurial data or metadata. See ':hg: bundle' for lossless transmission.<br>
    <br>
    Use --partial to ensure a changeset will be created from the patch even if some hunks fail to apply. Hunks that fail to apply will be written to a &lt;target-file&gt;.rej file. Conflicts can then be resolved by hand before <strong>hg commit --amend</strong> is run to update the created changeset. This flag exists to let people import patches that partially apply without losing the associated metadata (author, date, description, ...).
    <dl class="indent-2">
      <dt>Note
      <dd>
        <p>When no hunks apply cleanly, <strong>hg import --partial</strong> will create an empty changeset, importing only the patch metadata.<br>
        <br>
        With -s/--similarity, hg will attempt to discover renames and copies in the patch in the same way as <strong>hg addremove</strong>.<br>
        <br>
        It is possible to use external patch programs to perform the patch by setting the <strong>ui.patch</strong> configuration option. For the default internal tool, the fuzz can also be configured via <strong>patch.fuzz</strong>. See <strong>hg help config</strong> for more information about configuration files and how to use these options.<br>
        <br>
        See <strong>hg help dates</strong> for a list of formats valid for -d/--date.<br>
        <br>
        Examples:

      <dd>

      <dt>·
      <dd>
        <p>change the default fuzzing from 2 to a less strict 7<br>

    <h3>log</h3>
    <p>show revision history of entire repository or files:<br>
    <br>
    <pre> hg log [OPTION]... [FILE]
</pre>
    <p>Print the revision history of the specified files or the entire project.<br>
    <br>
    If no revision range is specified, the default is <strong>tip:0</strong> unless --follow is set, in which case the working directory parent is used as the starting revision.<br>
    <br>
    File history is shown without following rename or copy history of files. Use -f/--follow with a filename to follow history across renames and copies. --follow without a filename will only show ancestors or descendants of the starting revision.<br>
    <br>
    By default this command prints revision number and changeset id, tags, non-trivial parents, user, date and time, and a summary for each commit. When the -v/--verbose switch is used, the list of changed files and full commit message are shown.<br>
    <br>
    With --graph the revisions are shown as an ASCII art DAG with the most recent changeset at the top. 'o' is a changeset, '@' is a working directory parent, 'x' is obsolete, and '+' represents a fork where the changeset from the lines below is a parent of the 'o' merge on the same line.

      <dt>Note

        <p><strong>hg log --patch</strong> may generate unexpected diff output for merge changesets, as it will only compare the merge changeset against its first parent. Also, only files different from BOTH parents will appear in files:.
      <dt>Note

        <p>For performance reasons, <strong>hg log FILE</strong> may omit duplicate changes made on branches and will not show removals or mode changes. To see all such changes, use the --removed switch.<br>

    <h3>push</h3>
    <p>push changes to the specified destination:<br>
    <br>
    <pre> hg push [-f] [-r REV]... [-e CMD] [--remotecmd CMD] [DEST]
</pre>
    <p>Push changesets from the local repository to the specified destination.<br>
    <br>
    This operation is symmetrical to pull: it is identical to a pull in the destination repository from the current one.<br>
    <br>
    By default, push will not allow creation of new heads at the destination, since multiple heads would make it unclear which head to use. In this situation, it is recommended to pull and merge before pushing.<br>
    <br>
    Use --new-branch if you want to allow push to create a new named branch that is not present at the destination. This allows you to only create a new branch without forcing other changes.
    <dl>
      <dt>Note
      <dd>
        <p>Extra care should be taken with the -f/--force option, which will push all new heads on all branches, an action which will almost always cause confusion for collaborators.<br>
        <br>
        If -r/--rev is used, the specified revision and all its ancestors will be pushed to the remote repository.<br>
        <br>
        If -B/--bookmark is used, the specified bookmarked revision, its ancestors, and the bookmark will be pushed to the remote repository. Specifying <strong>.</strong> is equivalent to specifying the active bookmark's name.<br>
        <br>
        Please see <strong>hg help urls</strong> for important details about <strong>ssh://</strong> URLs. If DESTINATION is omitted, a default path will be used.<br>

    The following table details the behavior of remove for different file states (columns) and option combinations (rows).

    <h3>resolve</h3>
    <p>redo merges or set/view the merge status of files:<br>

    <pre> hg resolve [OPTION]... [FILE]...
</pre>
    <p>Merges with unresolved conflicts are often the result of non-interactive merging using the <strong>internal:merge</strong> configuration setting, or a command-line merge tool like <strong>diff3</strong>. The resolve command is used to manage the files involved in a merge, after <strong>hg merge</strong> has been run, and before <strong>hg commit</strong> is run (i.e. the working directory must have two parents). See <strong>hg help merge-tools</strong> for information on configuring merge tools.<br>
    <br>
    The resolve command can be used in the following ways:
    <dl class="indent-2">
      <dt>·
      <dd>
        <p><strong>hg resolve [--tool TOOL] FILE...</strong>: attempt to re-merge the specified files, discarding any previous merge attempts. Re-merging is not performed for files already marked as resolved. Use <strong>--all/-a</strong> to select all unresolved files. <strong>--tool</strong> can be used to specify the merge tool used for the given files. It overrides the HGMERGE environment variable and your configuration files. Previous file contents are saved with a <strong>.orig</strong> suffix.
      <dt>·
      <dd>
        <p><strong>hg resolve -m [FILE]</strong>: mark a file as having been resolved (e.g. after having manually fixed-up the files). The default is to mark all unresolved files.
      <dt>·
      <dd>
        <p><strong>hg resolve -u [FILE]...</strong>: mark a file as unresolved. The default is to mark all resolved files.
      <dt>·
      <dd>
        <p><strong>hg resolve -l</strong>: list files which had or still have conflicts. In the printed list, <strong>U</strong> = unresolved and <strong>R</strong> = resolved.
      <dt>Note
      <dd>
        <p>Mercurial will not let you commit files with unresolved merge conflicts. You must use <strong>hg resolve -m ...</strong> before you can commit after a conflicting merge.<br>
        <br>
        Returns 0 on success, 1 if any files fail a resolve attempt.<br>

</pre>
    <dl>
      <dt>Note
      <dd>
        <p>To check out earlier revisions, you should use <strong>hg update REV</strong>. To cancel an uncommitted merge (and lose your changes), use <strong>hg update --clean .</strong>.<br>
        <br>
        With no revision specified, revert the specified files or directories to the contents they had in the parent of the working directory. This restores the contents of files to an unmodified state and unschedules adds, removes, copies, and renames. If the working directory has two parents, you must explicitly specify a revision.<br>
        <br>
        Using the -r/--rev or -d/--date options, revert the given files or directories to their states as of a specific revision. Because revert does not change the working directory parents, this will cause these files to appear modified. This can be helpful to “back out” some or all of an earlier change. See <strong>hg backout</strong> for a related method.<br>
        <br>
        Modified files are saved with a .orig suffix before reverting. To disable these backups, use --no-backup. It is possible to store the backup files in a custom directory relative to the root of the repository by setting the <strong>ui.origbackuppath</strong> configuration option.<br>
        <br>
        See <strong>hg help dates</strong> for a list of formats valid for -d/--date.<br>

    <h3>rollback</h3>
    <p>roll back the last transaction (DANGEROUS) (DEPRECATED):<br>
    <br>
    <pre> hg rollback
</pre>
    <p>Please use <strong>hg commit --amend</strong> instead of rollback to correct mistakes in the last commit.<br>
    <br>
    This command should be used with care. There is only one level of rollback, and there is no way to undo a rollback. It will also restore the dirstate at the time of the last transaction, losing any dirstate changes since that time. This command does not alter the working directory.<br>
    <br>
    Transactions are used to encapsulate the effects of all commands that create new changesets or propagate existing changesets into a repository.<br>
    <br>
    For example, the following commands are transactional, and their effects can be rolled back:
    <dl class="indent-2">
      <dt>·
      <dd>
        <p>commit
      <dt>·
      <dd>
        <p>import
      <dt>·
      <dd>
        <p>pull
      <dt>·
      <dd>
        <p>push (with this repository as the destination)
      <dt>·
      <dd>
        <p>unbundle<br>
        <br>
        To avoid permanent data loss, rollback will refuse to rollback a commit transaction if it isn't checked out. Use --force to override this protection.<br>
        <br>
        The rollback command can be entirely disabled by setting the <strong>ui.rollback</strong> configuration setting to false. If you're here because you want to use rollback and it's disabled, you can re-enable the command by setting <strong>ui.rollback</strong> to true.<br>
        <br>
        This command is not intended for use on public repositories. Once changes are visible for pull by other users, rolling a transaction back locally is ineffective (someone else may already have pulled the changes). Furthermore, a race is possible with readers of the repository; for example an in-progress pull from the repository may fail if a rollback is performed.<br>
        <br>
        Returns 0 on success, 1 if no rollback data is available.<br>

    <br>
    Please note that the server does not implement access control. This means that, by default, anybody can read from the server and nobody can write to it by default. Set the <strong>web.allow_push</strong> option to <strong>*</strong> to allow everybody to push to the server. You should use a real web server if you need to authenticate users.<br>
    <br>
    By default, the server logs accesses to stdout and errors to stderr. Use the -A/--accesslog and -E/--errorlog options to log to files.<br>
    <br>
    To have the server choose a free port number to listen on, specify a port number of 0; in this case, the server will print the port number it uses.<br>

        <p><strong>hg status</strong> may appear to disagree with diff if permissions have changed or a merge has occurred. The standard diff format does not report permission changes and diff only reports changes relative to one merge parent.<br>
        <br>
        If one revision is given, it is used as the base revision. If two revisions are given, the differences between them are shown. The --change option can also be used as a shortcut to list the changed files of a revision from its first parent.<br>
        <br>
        The codes used to show the status of files are:<br>
        <br>
        <pre> M = modified
 A = added
 R = removed
 C = clean
 ! = missing (deleted by non-hg command, but still tracked)
 ? = not tracked
 I = ignored
   = origin of the previous file (with --copies)

</pre>
    <p>Name a particular revision using &lt;name&gt;.<br>
    <br>
    Tags are used to name particular revisions of the repository and are very useful to compare different revisions, to go back to significant earlier versions or to mark branch points as releases, etc. Changing an existing tag is normally disallowed; use -f/--force to override.<br>
    <br>
    If no revision is given, the parent of the working directory is used.<br>
    <br>
    To facilitate version control, distribution, and merging of tags, they are stored as a file named “.hgtags” which is managed similarly to other project files and can be hand-edited if necessary. This also means that tagging creates a new commit. The file “.hg/localtags” is used for local tags (not shared among repositories).<br>
    <br>
    Tag commits are usually made at the head of a branch. If the parent of the working directory is not a branch head, <strong>hg tag</strong> aborts; use -f/--force to force the tag commit to be based on a non-head changeset.<br>
    <br>
    See <strong>hg help dates</strong> for a list of formats valid for -d/--date.<br>
    <br>
    Since tag names have priority over branch names during revision lookup, using an existing branch name as a tag name is discouraged.<br>

      <dd>
        <p>With the -c/--check option, the update is aborted and the uncommitted changes are preserved.

  <h2>DATE FORMATS</h2>
  <p>Some commands allow the user to specify a date, e.g.:
  <dl class="indent-2">
    <dt>·
    <dd>
      <p>backout, commit, import, tag: Specify the commit date.
    <dt>·
    <dd>
      <p>log, revert, update: Select revision(s) by date.<br>
      <br>
      Many date formats are valid. Here are some examples:
    <dt>·
    <dd>
      <p><strong>Wed Dec 6 13:18:29 2006</strong> (local timezone assumed)
    <dt>·
    <dd>
      <p><strong>Dec 6 13:18 -0600</strong> (year assumed, time offset provided)
    <dt>·
    <dd>
      <p><strong>Dec 6 13:18 UTC</strong> (UTC and GMT are aliases for +0000)
    <dt>·
    <dd>
      <p><strong>Dec 6</strong> (midnight)
    <dt>·
    <dd>
      <p><strong>13:18</strong> (today assumed)
    <dt>·
    <dd>
      <p><strong>3:39</strong> (3:39AM assumed)
    <dt>·
    <dd>
      <p><strong>3:39pm</strong> (15:39)
    <dt>·
    <dd>
      <p><strong>2006-12-06 13:18:29</strong> (ISO 8601 format)
    <dt>·
    <dd>
      <p><strong>2006-12-6 13:18</strong>
    <dt>·
    <dd>
      <p><strong>2006-12-6</strong>
    <dt>·
    <dd>
      <p><strong>12-6</strong>
    <dt>·
    <dd>
      <p><strong>12/6</strong>
    <dt>·
    <dd>
      <p><strong>12/6/6</strong> (Dec 6 2006)
    <dt>·
    <dd>
      <p><strong>today</strong> (midnight)
    <dt>·
    <dd>
      <p><strong>yesterday</strong> (midnight)
    <dt>·
    <dd>
      <p><strong>now</strong> - right now<br>
      <br>
      Lastly, there is Mercurial's internal format:
    <dt>·
    <dd>
      <p><strong>1165411109 0</strong> (Wed Dec 6 13:18:29 2006 UTC)<br>
      <br>
      This is the internal representation format for dates. The first number is the number of seconds since the epoch (1970-01-01 00:00 UTC). The second is the offset of the local timezone, in seconds west of UTC (negative if the timezone is east of UTC).<br>
      <br>
      The log command also accepts date ranges:
    <dt>·
    <dd>
      <p><strong>&lt;DATE</strong> - at or before a given date/time
    <dt>·
    <dd>
      <p><strong>&gt;DATE</strong> - on or after a given date/time
    <dt>·
    <dd>
      <p><strong>DATE to DATE</strong> - a date range, inclusive
    <dt>·
    <dd>
      <p><strong>-DAYS</strong> - within a given number of days of today
  </dl>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <h2>DIFF FORMATS</h2>
  <p>Mercurial's default format for showing changes between two versions of a file is compatible with the unified format of GNU diff, which can be used by GNU patch and many other standard tools.<br>
  <br>
  While this standard format is often enough, it does not encode the following information:
  <dl class="indent-2">
    <dt>·
    <dd>
      <p>executable status and other permission bits
    <dt>·
    <dd>
      <p>copy or rename information
    <dt>·
    <dd>
      <p>changes in binary files
    <dt>·
    <dd>
      <p>creation or deletion of empty files<br>
      <br>
      Mercurial also supports the extended diff format from the git VCS which addresses these limitations. The git diff format is not produced by default because a few widespread tools still do not understand this format.<br>
      <br>
      This means that when generating diffs from a Mercurial repository (e.g. with <strong>hg export</strong>), you should be careful about things like file copies and renames or other things mentioned above, because when applying a standard diff to a different repository, this extra information is lost. Mercurial's internal operations (like push and pull) are not affected by this, because they use an internal binary format for communicating changes.<br>
      <br>
      To make Mercurial produce the git extended diff format, use the --git option available for many commands, or set 'git = True' in the [diff] section of your configuration file. You do not need to set this option when importing diffs in this format or using them in the mq extension.
  </dl>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <h2>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES</h2>
  <dl>
    <dt><strong>HG</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Path to the 'hg' executable, automatically passed when running hooks, extensions or external tools. If unset or empty, this is the hg executable's name if it's frozen, or an executable named 'hg' (with %PATHEXT% [defaulting to COM/EXE/BAT/CMD] extensions on Windows) is searched.
    <dt><strong>HGEDITOR</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>This is the name of the editor to run when committing. See EDITOR.<br>
      <br>
      (deprecated, use configuration file)
    <dt><strong>HGENCODING</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>This overrides the default locale setting detected by Mercurial. This setting is used to convert data including usernames, changeset descriptions, tag names, and branches. This setting can be overridden with the --encoding command-line option.
    <dt><strong>HGENCODINGMODE</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>This sets Mercurial's behavior for handling unknown characters while transcoding user input. The default is “strict”, which causes Mercurial to abort if it can't map a character. Other settings include “replace”, which replaces unknown characters, and “ignore”, which drops them. This setting can be overridden with the --encodingmode command-line option.
    <dt><strong>HGENCODINGAMBIGUOUS</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>This sets Mercurial's behavior for handling characters with “ambiguous” widths like accented Latin characters with East Asian fonts. By default, Mercurial assumes ambiguous characters are narrow, set this variable to “wide” if such characters cause formatting problems.
    <dt><strong>HGMERGE</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>An executable to use for resolving merge conflicts. The program will be executed with three arguments: local file, remote file, ancestor file.<br>
      <br>
      (deprecated, use configuration file)
    <dt><strong>HGRCPATH</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>A list of files or directories to search for configuration files. Item separator is “:” on Unix, “;” on Windows. If HGRCPATH is not set, platform default search path is used. If empty, only the .hg/hgrc from the current repository is read.<br>
      <br>
      For each element in HGRCPATH:
  </dl>
  <dl class="indent-2">
    <dt>·
    <dd>
      <p>if it's a directory, all files ending with .rc are added
    <dt>·
    <dd>
      <p>otherwise, the file itself will be added
    <dt><strong>HGPLAIN</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>When set, this disables any configuration settings that might change Mercurial's default output. This includes encoding, defaults, verbose mode, debug mode, quiet mode, tracebacks, and localization. This can be useful when scripting against Mercurial in the face of existing user configuration.<br>
      <br>
      Equivalent options set via command line flags or environment variables are not overridden.
    <dt><strong>HGPLAINEXCEPT</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>This is a comma-separated list of features to preserve when HGPLAIN is enabled. Currently the following values are supported:
    <dt><strong>alias</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Don't remove aliases.
    <dt><strong>i18n</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Preserve internationalization.
    <dt><strong>revsetalias</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Don't remove revset aliases.
    <dt><strong>templatealias</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Don't remove template aliases.
    <dt><strong>progress</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Don't hide progress output.<br>
      <br>
      Setting HGPLAINEXCEPT to anything (even an empty string) will enable plain mode.
    <dt><strong>HGUSER</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>This is the string used as the author of a commit. If not set, available values will be considered in this order:
  </dl>
  <dl class="indent-2">
    <dt>·
    <dd>

      <p>This is the name of the editor to use when committing. See EDITOR.
    <dt><strong>EDITOR</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Sometimes Mercurial needs to open a text file in an editor for a user to modify, for example when writing commit messages. The editor it uses is determined by looking at the environment variables HGEDITOR, VISUAL and EDITOR, in that order. The first non-empty one is chosen. If all of them are empty, the editor defaults to 'vi'.
    <dt><strong>PYTHONPATH</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>This is used by Python to find imported modules and may need to be set appropriately if this Mercurial is not installed system-wide.

  <h2>USING ADDITIONAL FEATURES</h2>
  <p>Mercurial has the ability to add new features through the use of extensions. Extensions may add new commands, add options to existing commands, change the default behavior of commands, or implement hooks.<br>
  <br>
  To enable the “foo” extension, either shipped with Mercurial or in the Python search path, create an entry for it in your configuration file, like this:<br>
  <br>
  <pre> [extensions]
 foo =
</pre>
  <p>You may also specify the full path to an extension:<br>
  <br>
  <pre> [extensions]
 myfeature = ~/.hgext/myfeature.py
</pre>
  <p>See <strong>hg help config</strong> for more information on configuration files.<br>
  <br>
  Extensions are not loaded by default for a variety of reasons: they can increase startup overhead; they may be meant for advanced usage only; they may provide potentially dangerous abilities (such as letting you destroy or modify history); they might not be ready for prime time; or they may alter some usual behaviors of stock Mercurial. It is thus up to the user to activate extensions as needed.<br>
  <br>
  To explicitly disable an extension enabled in a configuration file of broader scope, prepend its path with !:<br>
  <br>
  <pre> [extensions]
 # disabling extension bar residing in /path/to/extension/bar.py
 bar = !/path/to/extension/bar.py
 # ditto, but no path was supplied for extension baz
 baz = !

  <h2>SPECIFYING FILE SETS</h2>
  <p>Mercurial supports a functional language for selecting a set of files.<br>
  <br>
  Like other file patterns, this pattern type is indicated by a prefix, 'set:'. The language supports a number of predicates which are joined by infix operators. Parenthesis can be used for grouping.<br>
  <br>
  Identifiers such as filenames or patterns must be quoted with single or double quotes if they contain characters outside of <strong>[.*{}[]?/\_a-zA-Z0-9\x80-\xff]</strong> or if they match one of the predefined predicates. This generally applies to file patterns other than globs and arguments for predicates.<br>
  <br>
  Special characters can be used in quoted identifiers by escaping them, e.g., <strong>\n</strong> is interpreted as a newline. To prevent them from being interpreted, strings can be prefixed with <strong>r</strong>, e.g. <strong>r'...'</strong>.<br>
  <br>
  There is a single prefix operator:
  <dl>
    <dt><strong>not x</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Files not in x. Short form is <strong>! x</strong>.<br>
      <br>
      These are the supported infix operators:
    <dt><strong>x and y</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>The intersection of files in x and y. Short form is <strong>x & y</strong>.
    <dt><strong>x or y</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>The union of files in x and y. There are two alternative short forms: <strong>x | y</strong> and <strong>x + y</strong>.
    <dt><strong>x - y</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Files in x but not in y.<br>
      <br>
      The following predicates are supported:
    <dt><strong>added()</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>File that is added according to <strong>hg status</strong>.
    <dt><strong>binary()</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>File that appears to be binary (contains NUL bytes).
    <dt><strong>clean()</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>File that is clean according to <strong>hg status</strong>.
    <dt><strong>copied()</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>File that is recorded as being copied.
    <dt><strong>deleted()</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Alias for <strong>missing()</strong>.
    <dt><strong>encoding(name)</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>File can be successfully decoded with the given character encoding. May not be useful for encodings other than ASCII and UTF-8.
    <dt><strong>eol(style)</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>File contains newlines of the given style (dos, unix, mac). Binary files are excluded, files with mixed line endings match multiple styles.
    <dt><strong>exec()</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>File that is marked as executable.
    <dt><strong>grep(regex)</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>File contains the given regular expression.
    <dt><strong>hgignore()</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>File that matches the active .hgignore pattern.
    <dt><strong>ignored()</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>File that is ignored according to <strong>hg status</strong>. These files will only be considered if this predicate is used.
    <dt><strong>missing()</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>File that is missing according to <strong>hg status</strong>.
    <dt><strong>modified()</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>File that is modified according to <strong>hg status</strong>.
    <dt><strong>portable()</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>File that has a portable name. (This doesn't include filenames with case collisions.)
    <dt><strong>removed()</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>File that is removed according to <strong>hg status</strong>.
    <dt><strong>resolved()</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>File that is marked resolved according to <strong>hg resolve -l</strong>.
    <dt><strong>size(expression)</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>File size matches the given expression. Examples:
  </dl>
  <dl class="indent-2">
    <dt>·
    <dd>
      <p>1k (files from 1024 to 2047 bytes)
    <dt>·
    <dd>
      <p>&lt; 20k (files less than 20480 bytes)
    <dt>·
    <dd>
      <p>&gt;= .5MB (files at least 524288 bytes)
    <dt>·
    <dd>
      <p>4k - 1MB (files from 4096 bytes to 1048576 bytes)

      <p>File that is marked as a symlink.
    <dt><strong>unknown()</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>File that is unknown according to <strong>hg status</strong>. These files will only be considered if this predicate is used.
    <dt><strong>unresolved()</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>File that is marked unresolved according to <strong>hg resolve -l</strong>.<br>
      <br>

  <h2>GLOSSARY</h2>
  <dl>
    <dt><strong>Ancestor</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Any changeset that can be reached by an unbroken chain of parent changesets from a given changeset. More precisely, the ancestors of a changeset can be defined by two properties: a parent of a changeset is an ancestor, and a parent of an ancestor is an ancestor. See also: 'Descendant'.
    <dt><strong>Bookmark</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Bookmarks are pointers to certain commits that move when committing. They are similar to tags in that it is possible to use bookmark names in all places where Mercurial expects a changeset ID, e.g., with <strong>hg update</strong>. Unlike tags, bookmarks move along when you make a commit.<br>
      <br>
      Bookmarks can be renamed, copied and deleted. Bookmarks are local, unless they are explicitly pushed or pulled between repositories. Pushing and pulling bookmarks allow you to collaborate with others on a branch without creating a named branch.
    <dt><strong>Branch</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>(Noun) A child changeset that has been created from a parent that is not a head. These are known as topological branches, see 'Branch, topological'. If a topological branch is named, it becomes a named branch. If a topological branch is not named, it becomes an anonymous branch. See 'Branch, anonymous' and 'Branch, named'.<br>
      <br>
      Branches may be created when changes are pulled from or pushed to a remote repository, since new heads may be created by these operations. Note that the term branch can also be used informally to describe a development process in which certain development is done independently of other development. This is sometimes done explicitly with a named branch, but it can also be done locally, using bookmarks or clones and anonymous branches.<br>
      <br>
      Example: “The experimental branch.”<br>
      <br>
      (Verb) The action of creating a child changeset which results in its parent having more than one child.<br>
      <br>
      Example: “I'm going to branch at X.”
    <dt><strong>Branch, anonymous</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Every time a new child changeset is created from a parent that is not a head and the name of the branch is not changed, a new anonymous branch is created.
    <dt><strong>Branch, closed</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>A named branch whose branch heads have all been closed.
    <dt><strong>Branch, default</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>The branch assigned to a changeset when no name has previously been assigned.
    <dt><strong>Branch head</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>See 'Head, branch'.
    <dt><strong>Branch, inactive</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>If a named branch has no topological heads, it is considered to be inactive. As an example, a feature branch becomes inactive when it is merged into the default branch. The <strong>hg branches</strong> command shows inactive branches by default, though they can be hidden with <strong>hg branches --active</strong>.<br>
      <br>
      NOTE: this concept is deprecated because it is too implicit. Branches should now be explicitly closed using <strong>hg commit --close-branch</strong> when they are no longer needed.
    <dt><strong>Branch, named</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>A collection of changesets which have the same branch name. By default, children of a changeset in a named branch belong to the same named branch. A child can be explicitly assigned to a different branch. See <strong>hg help branch</strong>, <strong>hg help branches</strong> and <strong>hg commit --close-branch</strong> for more information on managing branches.<br>
      <br>
      Named branches can be thought of as a kind of namespace, dividing the collection of changesets that comprise the repository into a collection of disjoint subsets. A named branch is not necessarily a topological branch. If a new named branch is created from the head of another named branch, or the default branch, but no further changesets are added to that previous branch, then that previous branch will be a branch in name only.
    <dt><strong>Branch tip</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>See 'Tip, branch'.
    <dt><strong>Branch, topological</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Every time a new child changeset is created from a parent that is not a head, a new topological branch is created. If a topological branch is named, it becomes a named branch. If a topological branch is not named, it becomes an anonymous branch of the current, possibly default, branch.
    <dt><strong>Changelog</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>A record of the changesets in the order in which they were added to the repository. This includes details such as changeset id, author, commit message, date, and list of changed files.
    <dt><strong>Changeset</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>A snapshot of the state of the repository used to record a change.
    <dt><strong>Changeset, child</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>The converse of parent changeset: if P is a parent of C, then C is a child of P. There is no limit to the number of children that a changeset may have.
    <dt><strong>Changeset id</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>A SHA-1 hash that uniquely identifies a changeset. It may be represented as either a “long” 40 hexadecimal digit string, or a “short” 12 hexadecimal digit string.
    <dt><strong>Changeset, merge</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>A changeset with two parents. This occurs when a merge is committed.
    <dt><strong>Changeset, parent</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>A revision upon which a child changeset is based. Specifically, a parent changeset of a changeset C is a changeset whose node immediately precedes C in the DAG. Changesets have at most two parents.
    <dt><strong>Checkout</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>(Noun) The working directory being updated to a specific revision. This use should probably be avoided where possible, as changeset is much more appropriate than checkout in this context.<br>
      <br>
      Example: “I'm using checkout X.”<br>
      <br>
      (Verb) Updating the working directory to a specific changeset. See <strong>hg help update</strong>.<br>
      <br>
      Example: “I'm going to check out changeset X.”
    <dt><strong>Child changeset</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>See 'Changeset, child'.
    <dt><strong>Close changeset</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>See 'Head, closed branch'.
    <dt><strong>Closed branch</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>See 'Branch, closed'.
    <dt><strong>Clone</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>(Noun) An entire or partial copy of a repository. The partial clone must be in the form of a revision and its ancestors.<br>
      <br>
      Example: “Is your clone up to date?”<br>
      <br>
      (Verb) The process of creating a clone, using <strong>hg clone</strong>.<br>
      <br>
      Example: “I'm going to clone the repository.”
    <dt><strong>Closed branch head</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>See 'Head, closed branch'.
    <dt><strong>Commit</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>(Noun) A synonym for changeset.<br>
      <br>
      Example: “Is the bug fixed in your recent commit?”<br>
      <br>
      (Verb) The act of recording changes to a repository. When files are committed in a working directory, Mercurial finds the differences between the committed files and their parent changeset, creating a new changeset in the repository.<br>
      <br>
      Example: “You should commit those changes now.”
    <dt><strong>Cset</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>A common abbreviation of the term changeset.
    <dt><strong>DAG</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>The repository of changesets of a distributed version control system (DVCS) can be described as a directed acyclic graph (DAG), consisting of nodes and edges, where nodes correspond to changesets and edges imply a parent -&gt; child relation. This graph can be visualized by graphical tools such as <strong>hg log --graph</strong>. In Mercurial, the DAG is limited by the requirement for children to have at most two parents.
    <dt><strong>Deprecated</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Feature removed from documentation, but not scheduled for removal.
    <dt><strong>Default branch</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>See 'Branch, default'.
    <dt><strong>Descendant</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Any changeset that can be reached by a chain of child changesets from a given changeset. More precisely, the descendants of a changeset can be defined by two properties: the child of a changeset is a descendant, and the child of a descendant is a descendant. See also: 'Ancestor'.
    <dt><strong>Diff</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>(Noun) The difference between the contents and attributes of files in two changesets or a changeset and the current working directory. The difference is usually represented in a standard form called a “diff” or “patch”. The “git diff” format is used when the changes include copies, renames, or changes to file attributes, none of which can be represented/handled by classic “diff” and “patch”.<br>
      <br>
      Example: “Did you see my correction in the diff?”<br>
      <br>
      (Verb) Diffing two changesets is the action of creating a diff or patch.<br>
      <br>
      Example: “If you diff with changeset X, you will see what I mean.”
    <dt><strong>Directory, working</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>The working directory represents the state of the files tracked by Mercurial, that will be recorded in the next commit. The working directory initially corresponds to the snapshot at an existing changeset, known as the parent of the working directory. See 'Parent, working directory'. The state may be modified by changes to the files introduced manually or by a merge. The repository metadata exists in the .hg directory inside the working directory.
    <dt><strong>Draft</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Changesets in the draft phase have not been shared with publishing repositories and may thus be safely changed by history-modifying extensions. See <strong>hg help phases</strong>.
    <dt><strong>Experimental</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Feature that may change or be removed at a later date.
    <dt><strong>Graph</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>See DAG and <strong>hg log --graph</strong>.
    <dt><strong>Head</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>The term 'head' may be used to refer to both a branch head or a repository head, depending on the context. See 'Head, branch' and 'Head, repository' for specific definitions.<br>
      <br>
      Heads are where development generally takes place and are the usual targets for update and merge operations.
    <dt><strong>Head, branch</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>A changeset with no descendants on the same named branch.
    <dt><strong>Head, closed branch</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>A changeset that marks a head as no longer interesting. The closed head is no longer listed by <strong>hg heads</strong>. A branch is considered closed when all its heads are closed and consequently is not listed by <strong>hg branches</strong>.<br>
      <br>
      Closed heads can be re-opened by committing new changeset as the child of the changeset that marks a head as closed.
    <dt><strong>Head, repository</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>A topological head which has not been closed.
    <dt><strong>Head, topological</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>A changeset with no children in the repository.
    <dt><strong>History, immutable</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Once committed, changesets cannot be altered. Extensions which appear to change history actually create new changesets that replace existing ones, and then destroy the old changesets. Doing so in public repositories can result in old changesets being reintroduced to the repository.
    <dt><strong>History, rewriting</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>The changesets in a repository are immutable. However, extensions to Mercurial can be used to alter the repository, usually in such a way as to preserve changeset contents.
    <dt><strong>Immutable history</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>See 'History, immutable'.
    <dt><strong>Merge changeset</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>See 'Changeset, merge'.
    <dt><strong>Manifest</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Each changeset has a manifest, which is the list of files that are tracked by the changeset.
    <dt><strong>Merge</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Used to bring together divergent branches of work. When you update to a changeset and then merge another changeset, you bring the history of the latter changeset into your working directory. Once conflicts are resolved (and marked), this merge may be committed as a merge changeset, bringing two branches together in the DAG.
    <dt><strong>Named branch</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>See 'Branch, named'.
    <dt><strong>Null changeset</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>The empty changeset. It is the parent state of newly-initialized repositories and repositories with no checked out revision. It is thus the parent of root changesets and the effective ancestor when merging unrelated changesets. Can be specified by the alias 'null' or by the changeset ID '000000000000'.
    <dt><strong>Parent</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>See 'Changeset, parent'.
    <dt><strong>Parent changeset</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>See 'Changeset, parent'.
    <dt><strong>Parent, working directory</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>The working directory parent reflects a virtual revision which is the child of the changeset (or two changesets with an uncommitted merge) shown by <strong>hg parents</strong>. This is changed with <strong>hg update</strong>. Other commands to see the working directory parent are <strong>hg summary</strong> and <strong>hg id</strong>. Can be specified by the alias “.”.
    <dt><strong>Patch</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>(Noun) The product of a diff operation.<br>
      <br>
      Example: “I've sent you my patch.”<br>
      <br>
      (Verb) The process of using a patch file to transform one changeset into another.<br>
      <br>
      Example: “You will need to patch that revision.”
    <dt><strong>Phase</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>A per-changeset state tracking how the changeset has been or should be shared. See <strong>hg help phases</strong>.
    <dt><strong>Public</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Changesets in the public phase have been shared with publishing repositories and are therefore considered immutable. See <strong>hg help phases</strong>.
    <dt><strong>Pull</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>An operation in which changesets in a remote repository which are not in the local repository are brought into the local repository. Note that this operation without special arguments only updates the repository, it does not update the files in the working directory. See <strong>hg help pull</strong>.
    <dt><strong>Push</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>An operation in which changesets in a local repository which are not in a remote repository are sent to the remote repository. Note that this operation only adds changesets which have been committed locally to the remote repository. Uncommitted changes are not sent. See <strong>hg help push</strong>.
    <dt><strong>Repository</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>The metadata describing all recorded states of a collection of files. Each recorded state is represented by a changeset. A repository is usually (but not always) found in the <strong>.hg</strong> subdirectory of a working directory. Any recorded state can be recreated by “updating” a working directory to a specific changeset.
    <dt><strong>Repository head</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>See 'Head, repository'.
    <dt><strong>Revision</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>A state of the repository at some point in time. Earlier revisions can be updated to by using <strong>hg update</strong>. See also 'Revision number'; See also 'Changeset'.
    <dt><strong>Revision number</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>This integer uniquely identifies a changeset in a specific repository. It represents the order in which changesets were added to a repository, starting with revision number 0. Note that the revision number may be different in each clone of a repository. To identify changesets uniquely between different clones, see 'Changeset id'.
    <dt><strong>Revlog</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>History storage mechanism used by Mercurial. It is a form of delta encoding, with occasional full revision of data followed by delta of each successive revision. It includes data and an index pointing to the data.
    <dt><strong>Rewriting history</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>See 'History, rewriting'.
    <dt><strong>Root</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>A changeset that has only the null changeset as its parent. Most repositories have only a single root changeset.
    <dt><strong>Secret</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Changesets in the secret phase may not be shared via push, pull, or clone. See <strong>hg help phases</strong>.
    <dt><strong>Tag</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>An alternative name given to a changeset. Tags can be used in all places where Mercurial expects a changeset ID, e.g., with <strong>hg update</strong>. The creation of a tag is stored in the history and will thus automatically be shared with other using push and pull.
    <dt><strong>Tip</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>The changeset with the highest revision number. It is the changeset most recently added in a repository.
    <dt><strong>Tip, branch</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>The head of a given branch with the highest revision number. When a branch name is used as a revision identifier, it refers to the branch tip. See also 'Branch, head'. Note that because revision numbers may be different in different repository clones, the branch tip may be different in different cloned repositories.
    <dt><strong>Update</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>(Noun) Another synonym of changeset.<br>
      <br>
      Example: “I've pushed an update.”<br>
      <br>
      (Verb) This term is usually used to describe updating the state of the working directory to that of a specific changeset. See <strong>hg help update</strong>.<br>
      <br>
      Example: “You should update.”
    <dt><strong>Working directory</strong>
    <dd>

  <h2>SYNTAX FOR MERCURIAL IGNORE FILES</h2>
  <div class="subsection">
    <h3>Synopsis</h3>
    <p>The Mercurial system uses a file called <strong>.hgignore</strong> in the root directory of a repository to control its behavior when it searches for files that it is not currently tracking.
  </div>
  <div class="subsection">
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>The working directory of a Mercurial repository will often contain files that should not be tracked by Mercurial. These include backup files created by editors and build products created by compilers. These files can be ignored by listing them in a <strong>.hgignore</strong> file in the root of the working directory. The <strong>.hgignore</strong> file must be created manually. It is typically put under version control, so that the settings will propagate to other repositories with push and pull.<br>
    <br>
    An untracked file is ignored if its path relative to the repository root directory, or any prefix path of that path, is matched against any pattern in <strong>.hgignore</strong>.<br>
    <br>
    For example, say we have an untracked file, <strong>file.c</strong>, at <strong>a/b/file.c</strong> inside our repository. Mercurial will ignore <strong>file.c</strong> if any pattern in <strong>.hgignore</strong> matches <strong>a/b/file.c</strong>, <strong>a/b</strong> or <strong>a</strong>.<br>
    <br>
    In addition, a Mercurial configuration file can reference a set of per-user or global ignore files. See the <strong>ignore</strong> configuration key on the <strong>[ui]</strong> section of <strong>hg help config</strong> for details of how to configure these files.<br>
    <br>
    To control Mercurial's handling of files that it manages, many commands support the <strong>-I</strong> and <strong>-X</strong> options; see <strong>hg help &lt;command&gt;</strong> and <strong>hg help patterns</strong> for details.<br>
    <br>
    Files that are already tracked are not affected by .hgignore, even if they appear in .hgignore. An untracked file X can be explicitly added with <strong>hg add X</strong>, even if X would be excluded by a pattern in .hgignore.
  </div>
  <div class="subsection">
    <h3>Syntax</h3>
    <p>An ignore file is a plain text file consisting of a list of patterns, with one pattern per line. Empty lines are skipped. The <strong>#</strong> character is treated as a comment character, and the <strong>\</strong> character is treated as an escape character.<br>
    <br>
    Mercurial supports several pattern syntaxes. The default syntax used is Python/Perl-style regular expressions.<br>
    <br>
    To change the syntax used, use a line of the following form:<br>
    <br>
    <pre> syntax: NAME
</pre>
    <p>where <strong>NAME</strong> is one of the following:
    <dl>
      <dt><strong>regexp</strong>
      <dd>
        <p>Regular expression, Python/Perl syntax.
      <dt><strong>glob</strong>
      <dd>
        <p>Shell-style glob.<br>
        <br>
        The chosen syntax stays in effect when parsing all patterns that follow, until another syntax is selected.<br>
        <br>
        Neither glob nor regexp patterns are rooted. A glob-syntax pattern of the form <strong>*.c</strong> will match a file ending in <strong>.c</strong> in any directory, and a regexp pattern of the form <strong>\.c$</strong> will do the same. To root a regexp pattern, start it with <strong>^</strong>.<br>
        <br>
        Subdirectories can have their own .hgignore settings by adding <strong>subinclude:path/to/subdir/.hgignore</strong> to the root <strong>.hgignore</strong>. See <strong>hg help patterns</strong> for details on <strong>subinclude:</strong> and <strong>include:</strong>.
    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dt>Note
      <dd>
        <p>Patterns specified in other than <strong>.hgignore</strong> are always rooted. Please see <strong>hg help patterns</strong> for details.
    </dl>
  </div>
  <div class="subsection">
    <h3>Example</h3>
    <p>Here is an example ignore file.<br>
    <br>
    <pre> # use glob syntax.
 syntax: glob

 *.elc
 *.pyc
 *~

 # switch to regexp syntax.
 syntax: regexp
 ^\.pc/
</pre>
  </div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>CONFIGURING HGWEB</h2>
  <p>Mercurial's internal web server, hgweb, can serve either a single repository, or a tree of repositories. In the second case, repository paths and global options can be defined using a dedicated configuration file common to <strong>hg serve</strong>, <strong>hgweb.wsgi</strong>, <strong>hgweb.cgi</strong> and <strong>hgweb.fcgi</strong>.<br>
  <br>
  This file uses the same syntax as other Mercurial configuration files but recognizes only the following sections:
  <dl class="indent-2">
    <dt>·
    <dd>
      <p>web
    <dt>·
    <dd>
      <p>paths
    <dt>·
    <dd>
      <p>collections<br>
      <br>
      The <strong>web</strong> options are thoroughly described in <strong>hg help config</strong>.<br>
      <br>
      The <strong>paths</strong> section maps URL paths to paths of repositories in the filesystem. hgweb will not expose the filesystem directly - only Mercurial repositories can be published and only according to the configuration.<br>
      <br>
      The left hand side is the path in the URL. Note that hgweb reserves subpaths like <strong>rev</strong> or <strong>file</strong>, try using different names for nested repositories to avoid confusing effects.<br>
      <br>
      The right hand side is the path in the filesystem. If the specified path ends with <strong>*</strong> or <strong>**</strong> the filesystem will be searched recursively for repositories below that point. With <strong>*</strong> it will not recurse into the repositories it finds (except for <strong>.hg/patches</strong>). With <strong>**</strong> it will also search inside repository working directories and possibly find subrepositories.<br>
      <br>
      In this example:<br>
      <br>
      <pre> [paths]
 /projects/a = /srv/tmprepos/a
 /projects/b = c:/repos/b
 / = /srv/repos/*
 /user/bob = /home/bob/repos/**
</pre>
    <dt>·
    <dd>
      <p>The first two entries make two repositories in different directories appear under the same directory in the web interface
    <dt>·
    <dd>
      <p>The third entry will publish every Mercurial repository found in <strong>/srv/repos/</strong>, for instance the repository <strong>/srv/repos/quux/</strong> will appear as <strong>http://server/quux/</strong>
    <dt>·
    <dd>
      <p>The fourth entry will publish both <strong>http://server/user/bob/quux/</strong> and <strong>http://server/user/bob/quux/testsubrepo/</strong><br>
      <br>
      The <strong>collections</strong> section is deprecated and has been superseded by <strong>paths</strong>.
  </dl>
  <div class="subsection">
    <h3>URLs and Common Arguments</h3>
    <p>URLs under each repository have the form <strong>/{command}[/{arguments}]</strong> where <strong>{command}</strong> represents the name of a command or handler and <strong>{arguments}</strong> represents any number of additional URL parameters to that command.<br>
    <br>
    The web server has a default style associated with it. Styles map to a collection of named templates. Each template is used to render a specific piece of data, such as a changeset or diff.<br>
    <br>
    The style for the current request can be overwritten two ways. First, if <strong>{command}</strong> contains a hyphen (<strong>-</strong>), the text before the hyphen defines the style. For example, <strong>/atom-log</strong> will render the <strong>log</strong> command handler with the <strong>atom</strong> style. The second way to set the style is with the <strong>style</strong> query string argument. For example, <strong>/log?style=atom</strong>. The hyphenated URL parameter is preferred.<br>
    <br>
    Not all templates are available for all styles. Attempting to use a style that doesn't have all templates defined may result in an error rendering the page.<br>
    <br>
    Many commands take a <strong>{revision}</strong> URL parameter. This defines the changeset to operate on. This is commonly specified as the short, 12 digit hexadecimal abbreviation for the full 40 character unique revision identifier. However, any value described by <strong>hg help revisions</strong> typically works.
  </div>
  <div class="subsection">
    <h3>Commands and URLs</h3>
    <p>The following web commands and their URLs are available:
  </div>
  <div class="subsection">
    <h3>/annotate/{revision}/{path}</h3>
    <p>Show changeset information for each line in a file.<br>
    <br>
    The <strong>fileannotate</strong> template is rendered.
  </div>
  <div class="subsection">
    <h3>/archive/{revision}.{format}[/{path}]</h3>
    <p>Obtain an archive of repository content.<br>
    <br>
    The content and type of the archive is defined by a URL path parameter. <strong>format</strong> is the file extension of the archive type to be generated. e.g. <strong>zip</strong> or <strong>tar.bz2</strong>. Not all archive types may be allowed by your server configuration.<br>
    <br>
    The optional <strong>path</strong> URL parameter controls content to include in the archive. If omitted, every file in the specified revision is present in the archive. If included, only the specified file or contents of the specified directory will be included in the archive.<br>
    <br>
    No template is used for this handler. Raw, binary content is generated.
  </div>
  <div class="subsection">
    <h3>/bookmarks</h3>
    <p>Show information about bookmarks.<br>
    <br>
    No arguments are accepted.<br>
    <br>
    The <strong>bookmarks</strong> template is rendered.
  </div>
  <div class="subsection">
    <h3>/branches</h3>
    <p>Show information about branches.<br>
    <br>
    All known branches are contained in the output, even closed branches.<br>
    <br>
    No arguments are accepted.<br>
    <br>
    The <strong>branches</strong> template is rendered.
  </div>
  <div class="subsection">
    <h3>/changelog[/{revision}]</h3>
    <p>Show information about multiple changesets.<br>
    <br>
    If the optional <strong>revision</strong> URL argument is absent, information about all changesets starting at <strong>tip</strong> will be rendered. If the <strong>revision</strong> argument is present, changesets will be shown starting from the specified revision.<br>
    <br>
    If <strong>revision</strong> is absent, the <strong>rev</strong> query string argument may be defined. This will perform a search for changesets.<br>
    <br>
    The argument for <strong>rev</strong> can be a single revision, a revision set, or a literal keyword to search for in changeset data (equivalent to <strong>hg log -k</strong>).<br>
    <br>
    The <strong>revcount</strong> query string argument defines the maximum numbers of changesets to render.<br>
    <br>
    For non-searches, the <strong>changelog</strong> template will be rendered.
  </div>
  <div class="subsection">
    <h3>/changeset[/{revision}]</h3>
    <p>Show information about a single changeset.<br>
    <br>
    A URL path argument is the changeset identifier to show. See <strong>hg help revisions</strong> for possible values. If not defined, the <strong>tip</strong> changeset will be shown.<br>
    <br>
    The <strong>changeset</strong> template is rendered. Contents of the <strong>changesettag</strong>, <strong>changesetbookmark</strong>, <strong>filenodelink</strong>, <strong>filenolink</strong>, and the many templates related to diffs may all be used to produce the output.
  </div>
  <div class="subsection">
    <h3>/comparison/{revision}/{path}</h3>
    <p>Show a comparison between the old and new versions of a file from changes made on a particular revision.<br>
    <br>
    This is similar to the <strong>diff</strong> handler. However, this form features a split or side-by-side diff rather than a unified diff.<br>
    <br>
    The <strong>context</strong> query string argument can be used to control the lines of context in the diff.<br>
    <br>
    The <strong>filecomparison</strong> template is rendered.
  </div>
  <div class="subsection">
    <h3>/diff/{revision}/{path}</h3>
    <p>Show how a file changed in a particular commit.<br>
    <br>
    The <strong>filediff</strong> template is rendered.<br>
    <br>
    This handler is registered under both the <strong>/diff</strong> and <strong>/filediff</strong> paths. <strong>/diff</strong> is used in modern code.
  </div>
  <div class="subsection">
    <h3>/file/{revision}[/{path}]</h3>
    <p>Show information about a directory or file in the repository.<br>
    <br>
    Info about the <strong>path</strong> given as a URL parameter will be rendered.<br>
    <br>
    If <strong>path</strong> is a directory, information about the entries in that directory will be rendered. This form is equivalent to the <strong>manifest</strong> handler.<br>
    <br>
    If <strong>path</strong> is a file, information about that file will be shown via the <strong>filerevision</strong> template.<br>
    <br>
    If <strong>path</strong> is not defined, information about the root directory will be rendered.
  </div>
  <div class="subsection">
    <h3>/diff/{revision}/{path}</h3>
    <p>Show how a file changed in a particular commit.<br>
    <br>
    The <strong>filediff</strong> template is rendered.<br>
    <br>
    This handler is registered under both the <strong>/diff</strong> and <strong>/filediff</strong> paths. <strong>/diff</strong> is used in modern code.
  </div>
  <div class="subsection">
    <h3>/filelog/{revision}/{path}</h3>
    <p>Show information about the history of a file in the repository.<br>
    <br>
    The <strong>revcount</strong> query string argument can be defined to control the maximum number of entries to show.<br>
    <br>
    The <strong>filelog</strong> template will be rendered.
  </div>
  <div class="subsection">
    <h3>/graph[/{revision}]</h3>
    <p>Show information about the graphical topology of the repository.<br>
    <br>
    Information rendered by this handler can be used to create visual representations of repository topology.<br>
    <br>
    The <strong>revision</strong> URL parameter controls the starting changeset.<br>
    <br>
    The <strong>revcount</strong> query string argument can define the number of changesets to show information for.<br>
    <br>
    This handler will render the <strong>graph</strong> template.
  </div>
  <div class="subsection">
    <h3>/help[/{topic}]</h3>
    <p>Render help documentation.<br>
    <br>
    This web command is roughly equivalent to <strong>hg help</strong>. If a <strong>topic</strong> is defined, that help topic will be rendered. If not, an index of available help topics will be rendered.<br>
    <br>
    The <strong>help</strong> template will be rendered when requesting help for a topic. <strong>helptopics</strong> will be rendered for the index of help topics.
  </div>
  <div class="subsection">
    <h3>/log[/{revision}[/{path}]]</h3>
    <p>Show repository or file history.<br>
    <br>
    For URLs of the form <strong>/log/{revision}</strong>, a list of changesets starting at the specified changeset identifier is shown. If <strong>{revision}</strong> is not defined, the default is <strong>tip</strong>. This form is equivalent to the <strong>changelog</strong> handler.<br>
    <br>
    For URLs of the form <strong>/log/{revision}/{file}</strong>, the history for a specific file will be shown. This form is equivalent to the <strong>filelog</strong> handler.
  </div>
  <div class="subsection">
    <h3>/manifest[/{revision}[/{path}]]</h3>
    <p>Show information about a directory.<br>
    <br>
    If the URL path arguments are omitted, information about the root directory for the <strong>tip</strong> changeset will be shown.<br>
    <br>
    Because this handler can only show information for directories, it is recommended to use the <strong>file</strong> handler instead, as it can handle both directories and files.<br>
    <br>
    The <strong>manifest</strong> template will be rendered for this handler.
  </div>
  <div class="subsection">
    <h3>/changeset[/{revision}]</h3>
    <p>Show information about a single changeset.<br>
    <br>
    A URL path argument is the changeset identifier to show. See <strong>hg help revisions</strong> for possible values. If not defined, the <strong>tip</strong> changeset will be shown.<br>
    <br>
    The <strong>changeset</strong> template is rendered. Contents of the <strong>changesettag</strong>, <strong>changesetbookmark</strong>, <strong>filenodelink</strong>, <strong>filenolink</strong>, and the many templates related to diffs may all be used to produce the output.
  </div>
  <div class="subsection">
    <h3>/shortlog</h3>
    <p>Show basic information about a set of changesets.<br>
    <br>
    This accepts the same parameters as the <strong>changelog</strong> handler. The only difference is the <strong>shortlog</strong> template will be rendered instead of the <strong>changelog</strong> template.
  </div>
  <div class="subsection">
    <h3>/summary</h3>
    <p>Show a summary of repository state.<br>
    <br>
    Information about the latest changesets, bookmarks, tags, and branches is captured by this handler.<br>
    <br>
    The <strong>summary</strong> template is rendered.
  </div>
  <div class="subsection">
    <h3>/tags</h3>
    <p>Show information about tags.<br>

  <h2>MERGE TOOLS</h2>
  <p>To merge files Mercurial uses merge tools.<br>
  <br>
  A merge tool combines two different versions of a file into a merged file. Merge tools are given the two files and the greatest common ancestor of the two file versions, so they can determine the changes made on both branches.<br>
  <br>
  Merge tools are used both for <strong>hg resolve</strong>, <strong>hg merge</strong>, <strong>hg update</strong>, <strong>hg backout</strong> and in several extensions.<br>
  <br>
  Usually, the merge tool tries to automatically reconcile the files by combining all non-overlapping changes that occurred separately in the two different evolutions of the same initial base file. Furthermore, some interactive merge programs make it easier to manually resolve conflicting merges, either in a graphical way, or by inserting some conflict markers. Mercurial does not include any interactive merge programs but relies on external tools for that.
  <div class="subsection">
    <h3>Available merge tools</h3>
    <p>External merge tools and their properties are configured in the merge-tools configuration section - see hgrc(5) - but they can often just be named by their executable.<br>
    <br>
    A merge tool is generally usable if its executable can be found on the system and if it can handle the merge. The executable is found if it is an absolute or relative executable path or the name of an application in the executable search path. The tool is assumed to be able to handle the merge if it can handle symlinks if the file is a symlink, if it can handle binary files if the file is binary, and if a GUI is available if the tool requires a GUI.<br>
    <br>
    There are some internal merge tools which can be used. The internal merge tools are:
    <dl>
      <dt><strong>:dump</strong>
      <dd>
        <p>Creates three versions of the files to merge, containing the contents of local, other and base. These files can then be used to perform a merge manually. If the file to be merged is named <strong>a.txt</strong>, these files will accordingly be named <strong>a.txt.local</strong>, <strong>a.txt.other</strong> and <strong>a.txt.base</strong> and they will be placed in the same directory as <strong>a.txt</strong>.
      <dt><strong>:fail</strong>
      <dd>
        <p>Rather than attempting to merge files that were modified on both branches, it marks them as unresolved. The resolve command must be used to resolve these conflicts.
      <dt><strong>:local</strong>
      <dd>
        <p>Uses the local <em>p1()</em> version of files as the merged version.
      <dt><strong>:merge</strong>
      <dd>
        <p>Uses the internal non-interactive simple merge algorithm for merging files. It will fail if there are any conflicts and leave markers in the partially merged file. Markers will have two sections, one for each side of merge.
      <dt><strong>:merge-local</strong>
      <dd>
        <p>Like :merge, but resolve all conflicts non-interactively in favor of the local <em>p1()</em> changes.
      <dt><strong>:merge-other</strong>
      <dd>
        <p>Like :merge, but resolve all conflicts non-interactively in favor of the other <em>p2()</em> changes.
      <dt><strong>:merge3</strong>
      <dd>
        <p>Uses the internal non-interactive simple merge algorithm for merging files. It will fail if there are any conflicts and leave markers in the partially merged file. Marker will have three sections, one from each side of the merge and one for the base content.
      <dt><strong>:other</strong>
      <dd>
        <p>Uses the other <em>p2()</em> version of files as the merged version.
      <dt><strong>:prompt</strong>
      <dd>
        <p>Asks the user which of the local <em>p1()</em> or the other <em>p2()</em> version to keep as the merged version.
      <dt><strong>:tagmerge</strong>
      <dd>
        <p>Uses the internal tag merge algorithm (experimental).
      <dt><strong>:union</strong>
      <dd>
        <p>Uses the internal non-interactive simple merge algorithm for merging files. It will use both left and right sides for conflict regions. No markers are inserted.<br>
        <br>
        Internal tools are always available and do not require a GUI but will by default not handle symlinks or binary files.

  <h2>SPECIFYING MULTIPLE REVISIONS</h2>
  <p>When Mercurial accepts more than one revision, they may be specified individually, or provided as a topologically continuous range, separated by the “:” character.<br>
  <br>
  The syntax of range notation is [BEGIN]:[END], where BEGIN and END are revision identifiers. Both BEGIN and END are optional. If BEGIN is not specified, it defaults to revision number 0. If END is not specified, it defaults to the tip. The range “:” thus means “all revisions”.<br>
  <br>
  If BEGIN is greater than END, revisions are treated in reverse order.<br>
  <br>
  A range acts as a closed interval. This means that a range of 3:5 gives 3, 4 and 5. Similarly, a range of 9:6 gives 9, 8, 7, and 6.
</div>
<div class="section">
  <h2>FILE NAME PATTERNS</h2>
  <p>Mercurial accepts several notations for identifying one or more files at a time.<br>
  <br>
  By default, Mercurial treats filenames as shell-style extended glob patterns.<br>
  <br>
  Alternate pattern notations must be specified explicitly.
  <dl>
    <dt>Note
    <dd>
      <p>Patterns specified in <strong>.hgignore</strong> are not rooted. Please see <strong>hg help hgignore</strong> for details.<br>
      <br>
      To use a plain path name without any pattern matching, start it with <strong>path:</strong>. These path names must completely match starting at the current repository root.<br>
      <br>
      To use an extended glob, start a name with <strong>glob:</strong>. Globs are rooted at the current directory; a glob such as <strong>*.c</strong> will only match files in the current directory ending with <strong>.c</strong>.<br>
      <br>
      The supported glob syntax extensions are <strong>**</strong> to match any string across path separators and <strong>{a,b}</strong> to mean “a or b”.<br>
      <br>
      To use a Perl/Python regular expression, start a name with <strong>re:</strong>. Regexp pattern matching is anchored at the root of the repository.<br>
      <br>
      To read name patterns from a file, use <strong>listfile:</strong> or <strong>listfile0:</strong>. The latter expects null delimited patterns while the former expects line feeds. Each string read from the file is itself treated as a file pattern.<br>
      <br>
      To read a set of patterns from a file, use <strong>include:</strong> or <strong>subinclude:</strong>. <strong>include:</strong> will use all the patterns from the given file and treat them as if they had been passed in manually. <strong>subinclude:</strong> will only apply the patterns against files that are under the subinclude file's directory. See <strong>hg help hgignore</strong> for details on the format of these files.<br>
      <br>
      All patterns, except for <strong>glob:</strong> specified in command line (not for <strong>-I</strong> or <strong>-X</strong> options), can match also against directories: files under matched directories are treated as matched.<br>
      <br>
      Plain examples:<br>
      <br>
      <pre> path:foo/bar   a name bar in a directory named foo in the root
                of the repository
 path:path:name a file or directory named "path:name"
</pre>
      <p>Glob examples:<br>
      <br>
      <pre> glob:*.c       any name ending in ".c" in the current directory
 *.c            any name ending in ".c" in the current directory
 **.c           any name ending in ".c" in any subdirectory of the
                current directory including itself.
 foo/*.c        any name ending in ".c" in the directory foo
 foo/**.c       any name ending in ".c" in any subdirectory of foo
                including itself.
</pre>
      <p>Regexp examples:<br>
      <br>
      <pre> re:.*\.c$      any name ending in ".c", anywhere in the repository
</pre>
      <p>File examples:<br>
      <br>
      <pre> listfile:list.txt  read list from list.txt with one file pattern per line
 listfile0:list.txt read list from list.txt with null byte delimiters
</pre>
      <p>See also <strong>hg help filesets</strong>.<br>
      <br>
      Include examples:<br>
      <br>
      <pre> include:path/to/mypatternfile    reads patterns to be applied to all paths
 subinclude:path/to/subignorefile reads patterns specifically for paths in the

<div class="section">
  <h2>WORKING WITH PHASES</h2>
  <div class="subsection">
    <h3>What are phases?</h3>
    <p>Phases are a system for tracking which changesets have been or should be shared. This helps prevent common mistakes when modifying history (for instance, with the mq or rebase extensions).<br>
    <br>
    Each changeset in a repository is in one of the following phases:
    <dl class="indent-2">
      <dt>·
      <dd>
        <p>public : changeset is visible on a public server
      <dt>·
      <dd>
        <p>draft : changeset is not yet published
      <dt>·
      <dd>
        <p>secret : changeset should not be pushed, pulled, or cloned<br>
        <br>
        These phases are ordered (public &lt; draft &lt; secret) and no changeset can be in a lower phase than its ancestors. For instance, if a changeset is public, all its ancestors are also public. Lastly, changeset phases should only be changed towards the public phase.
    </dl>
  </div>
  <div class="subsection">
    <h3>How are phases managed?</h3>
    <p>For the most part, phases should work transparently. By default, a changeset is created in the draft phase and is moved into the public phase when it is pushed to another repository.<br>
    <br>
    Once changesets become public, extensions like mq and rebase will refuse to operate on them to prevent creating duplicate changesets. Phases can also be manually manipulated with the <strong>hg phase</strong> command if needed. See <strong>hg help -v phase</strong> for examples.<br>
    <br>
    To make yours commits secret by default, put this in your configuration file:<br>
    <br>
    <pre> [phases]
 new-commit = secret
</pre>
  </div>
  <div class="subsection">
    <h3>Phases and servers</h3>
    <p>Normally, all servers are <strong>publishing</strong> by default. This means:<br>
    <br>
    <pre> - all draft changesets that are pulled or cloned appear in phase
 public on the client

 - all draft changesets that are pushed appear as public on both
 client and server

 - secret changesets are neither pushed, pulled, or cloned
</pre>
    <dl>
      <dt>Note
      <dd>
        <p>Pulling a draft changeset from a publishing server does not mark it as public on the server side due to the read-only nature of pull.<br>
        <br>
        Sometimes it may be desirable to push and pull changesets in the draft phase to share unfinished work. This can be done by setting a repository to disable publishing in its configuration file:<br>
        <br>
        <pre> [phases]
 publish = False
</pre>
        <p>See <strong>hg help config</strong> for more information on configuration files.
      <dt>Note
      <dd>
        <p>Servers running older versions of Mercurial are treated as publishing.
      <dt>Note
      <dd>
        <p>Changesets in secret phase are not exchanged with the server. This applies to their content: file names, file contents, and changeset metadata. For technical reasons, the identifier (e.g. d825e4025e39) of the secret changeset may be communicated to the server.
    </dl>
  </div>
  <div class="subsection">
    <h3>Examples</h3>
    <dl class="indent-2">
      <dt>·
      <dd>
        <p>list changesets in draft or secret phase:<br>
        <br>
        <pre> hg log -r "not public()"
</pre>
      <dt>·
      <dd>
        <p>change all secret changesets to draft:<br>
        <br>
        <pre> hg phase --draft "secret()"
</pre>
      <dt>·
      <dd>
        <p>forcibly move the current changeset and descendants from public to draft:<br>
        <br>
        <pre> hg phase --force --draft .
</pre>
      <dt>·
      <dd>
        <p>show a list of changeset revision and phase:<br>
        <br>
        <pre> hg log --template "{rev} {phase}\n"
</pre>
      <dt>·
      <dd>
        <p>resynchronize draft changesets relative to a remote repository:<br>
        <br>
        <pre> hg phase -fd "outgoing(URL)"
</pre>

<div class="section">
  <h2>SPECIFYING SINGLE REVISIONS</h2>
  <p>Mercurial supports several ways to specify individual revisions.<br>
  <br>
  A plain integer is treated as a revision number. Negative integers are treated as sequential offsets from the tip, with -1 denoting the tip, -2 denoting the revision prior to the tip, and so forth.<br>
  <br>
  A 40-digit hexadecimal string is treated as a unique revision identifier.<br>
  <br>
  A hexadecimal string less than 40 characters long is treated as a unique revision identifier and is referred to as a short-form identifier. A short-form identifier is only valid if it is the prefix of exactly one full-length identifier.<br>
  <br>
  Any other string is treated as a bookmark, tag, or branch name. A bookmark is a movable pointer to a revision. A tag is a permanent name associated with a revision. A branch name denotes the tipmost open branch head of that branch - or if they are all closed, the tipmost closed head of the branch. Bookmark, tag, and branch names must not contain the “:” character.<br>
  <br>
  The reserved name “tip” always identifies the most recent revision.<br>
  <br>
  The reserved name “null” indicates the null revision. This is the revision of an empty repository, and the parent of revision 0.<br>
  <br>
  The reserved name “.” indicates the working directory parent. If no working directory is checked out, it is equivalent to null. If an uncommitted merge is in progress, “.” is the revision of the first parent.
</div>
<div class="section">
  <h2>SPECIFYING REVISION SETS</h2>
  <p>Mercurial supports a functional language for selecting a set of revisions.<br>
  <br>
  The language supports a number of predicates which are joined by infix operators. Parenthesis can be used for grouping.<br>
  <br>
  Identifiers such as branch names may need quoting with single or double quotes if they contain characters like <strong>-</strong> or if they match one of the predefined predicates.<br>
  <br>
  Special characters can be used in quoted identifiers by escaping them, e.g., <strong>\n</strong> is interpreted as a newline. To prevent them from being interpreted, strings can be prefixed with <strong>r</strong>, e.g. <strong>r'...'</strong>.<br>
  <br>
  There is a single prefix operator:
  <dl>
    <dt><strong>not x</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Changesets not in x. Short form is <strong>! x</strong>.<br>
      <br>
      These are the supported infix operators:
    <dt><strong>x::y</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>A DAG range, meaning all changesets that are descendants of x and ancestors of y, including x and y themselves. If the first endpoint is left out, this is equivalent to <strong>ancestors(y)</strong>, if the second is left out it is equivalent to <strong>descendants(x)</strong>.<br>
      <br>
      An alternative syntax is <strong>x..y</strong>.
    <dt><strong>x:y</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>All changesets with revision numbers between x and y, both inclusive. Either endpoint can be left out, they default to 0 and tip.
    <dt><strong>x and y</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>The intersection of changesets in x and y. Short form is <strong>x & y</strong>.
    <dt><strong>x or y</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>The union of changesets in x and y. There are two alternative short forms: <strong>x | y</strong> and <strong>x + y</strong>.
    <dt><strong>x - y</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Changesets in x but not in y.
    <dt><strong>x % y</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Changesets that are ancestors of x but not ancestors of y (i.e. ::x - ::y). This is shorthand notation for <strong>only(x, y)</strong> (see below). The second argument is optional and, if left out, is equivalent to <strong>only(x)</strong>.
    <dt><strong>x^n</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>The nth parent of x, n == 0, 1, or 2. For n == 0, x; for n == 1, the first parent of each changeset in x; for n == 2, the second parent of changeset in x.
    <dt><strong>x~n</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>The nth first ancestor of x; <strong>x~0</strong> is x; <strong>x~3</strong> is <strong>x^^^</strong>.<br>
      <br>
      There is a single postfix operator:
    <dt><strong>x^</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Equivalent to <strong>x^1</strong>, the first parent of each changeset in x.<br>
      <br>
      The following predicates are supported:
    <dt><strong>adds(pattern)</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Changesets that add a file matching pattern.<br>
      <br>
      The pattern without explicit kind like <strong>glob:</strong> is expected to be relative to the current directory and match against a file or a directory.
    <dt><strong>all()</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>All changesets, the same as <strong>0:tip</strong>.
    <dt><strong>ancestor(*changeset)</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>A greatest common ancestor of the changesets.<br>
      <br>
      Accepts 0 or more changesets. Will return empty list when passed no args. Greatest common ancestor of a single changeset is that changeset.
    <dt><strong>ancestors(set)</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Changesets that are ancestors of a changeset in set.
    <dt><strong>author(string)</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Alias for <strong>user(string)</strong>.
    <dt><strong>bisect(string)</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Changesets marked in the specified bisect status:
  </dl>
  <dl class="indent-2">
    <dt>·
    <dd>
      <p><strong>good</strong>, <strong>bad</strong>, <strong>skip</strong>: csets explicitly marked as good/bad/skip
    <dt>·
    <dd>
      <p><strong>goods</strong>, <strong>bads</strong> : csets topologically good/bad
    <dt>·
    <dd>
      <p><strong>range</strong> : csets taking part in the bisection
    <dt>·
    <dd>
      <p><strong>pruned</strong> : csets that are goods, bads or skipped
    <dt>·
    <dd>
      <p><strong>untested</strong> : csets whose fate is yet unknown
    <dt>·
    <dd>
      <p><strong>ignored</strong> : csets ignored due to DAG topology
    <dt>·
    <dd>
      <p><strong>current</strong> : the cset currently being bisected
    <dt><strong>bookmark([name])</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>The named bookmark or all bookmarks.<br>
      <br>
      If <em>name</em> starts with <em>re:</em>, the remainder of the name is treated as a regular expression. To match a bookmark that actually starts with <em>re:</em>, use the prefix <em>literal:</em>.
    <dt><strong>branch(string or set)</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>All changesets belonging to the given branch or the branches of the given changesets.<br>
      <br>
      If <em>string</em> starts with <em>re:</em>, the remainder of the name is treated as a regular expression. To match a branch that actually starts with <em>re:</em>, use the prefix <em>literal:</em>.
    <dt><strong>branchpoint()</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Changesets with more than one child.
    <dt><strong>bumped()</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Mutable changesets marked as successors of public changesets.<br>
      <br>
      Only non-public and non-obsolete changesets can be <em>bumped</em>.
    <dt><strong>bundle()</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Changesets in the bundle.<br>
      <br>
      Bundle must be specified by the -R option.
    <dt><strong>children(set)</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Child changesets of changesets in set.
    <dt><strong>closed()</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Changeset is closed.
    <dt><strong>contains(pattern)</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>The revision's manifest contains a file matching pattern (but might not modify it). See <strong>hg help patterns</strong> for information about file patterns.<br>
      <br>
      The pattern without explicit kind like <strong>glob:</strong> is expected to be relative to the current directory and match against a file exactly for efficiency.
    <dt><strong>converted([id])</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Changesets converted from the given identifier in the old repository if present, or all converted changesets if no identifier is specified.
    <dt><strong>date(interval)</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Changesets within the interval, see <strong>hg help dates</strong>.
    <dt><strong>desc(string)</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Search commit message for string. The match is case-insensitive.
    <dt><strong>descendants(set)</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Changesets which are descendants of changesets in set.
    <dt><strong>destination([set])</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Changesets that were created by a graft, transplant or rebase operation, with the given revisions specified as the source. Omitting the optional set is the same as passing all().
    <dt><strong>divergent()</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Final successors of changesets with an alternative set of final successors.
    <dt><strong>draft()</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Changeset in draft phase.
    <dt><strong>extinct()</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Obsolete changesets with obsolete descendants only.
    <dt><strong>extra(label, [value])</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Changesets with the given label in the extra metadata, with the given optional value.<br>
      <br>
      If <em>value</em> starts with <em>re:</em>, the remainder of the value is treated as a regular expression. To match a value that actually starts with <em>re:</em>, use the prefix <em>literal:</em>.
    <dt><strong>file(pattern)</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Changesets affecting files matched by pattern.<br>
      <br>
      For a faster but less accurate result, consider using <strong>filelog()</strong> instead.<br>
      <br>
      This predicate uses <strong>glob:</strong> as the default kind of pattern.
    <dt><strong>filelog(pattern)</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Changesets connected to the specified filelog.<br>
      <br>
      For performance reasons, visits only revisions mentioned in the file-level filelog, rather than filtering through all changesets (much faster, but doesn't include deletes or duplicate changes). For a slower, more accurate result, use <strong>file()</strong>.<br>
      <br>
      The pattern without explicit kind like <strong>glob:</strong> is expected to be relative to the current directory and match against a file exactly for efficiency.<br>
      <br>
      If some linkrev points to revisions filtered by the current repoview, we'll work around it to return a non-filtered value.
    <dt><strong>first(set, [n])</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>An alias for limit().
    <dt><strong>follow([pattern])</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>An alias for <strong>::.</strong> (ancestors of the working directory's first parent). If pattern is specified, the histories of files matching given pattern is followed, including copies.
    <dt><strong>grep(regex)</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Like <strong>keyword(string)</strong> but accepts a regex. Use <strong>grep(r'...')</strong> to ensure special escape characters are handled correctly. Unlike <strong>keyword(string)</strong>, the match is case-sensitive.
    <dt><strong>head()</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Changeset is a named branch head.
    <dt><strong>heads(set)</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Members of set with no children in set.
    <dt><strong>hidden()</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Hidden changesets.
    <dt><strong>id(string)</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Revision non-ambiguously specified by the given hex string prefix.
    <dt><strong>keyword(string)</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Search commit message, user name, and names of changed files for string. The match is case-insensitive.
    <dt><strong>last(set, [n])</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Last n members of set, defaulting to 1.
    <dt><strong>limit(set[, n[, offset]])</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>First n members of set, defaulting to 1, starting from offset.
    <dt><strong>matching(revision [, field])</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Changesets in which a given set of fields match the set of fields in the selected revision or set.<br>
      <br>
      To match more than one field pass the list of fields to match separated by spaces (e.g. <strong>author description</strong>).<br>
      <br>
      Valid fields are most regular revision fields and some special fields.<br>
      <br>
      Regular revision fields are <strong>description</strong>, <strong>author</strong>, <strong>branch</strong>, <strong>date</strong>, <strong>files</strong>, <strong>phase</strong>, <strong>parents</strong>, <strong>substate</strong>, <strong>user</strong> and <strong>diff</strong>. Note that <strong>author</strong> and <strong>user</strong> are synonyms. <strong>diff</strong> refers to the contents of the revision. Two revisions matching their <strong>diff</strong> will also match their <strong>files</strong>.<br>
      <br>
      Special fields are <strong>summary</strong> and <strong>metadata</strong>: <strong>summary</strong> matches the first line of the description. <strong>metadata</strong> is equivalent to matching <strong>description user date</strong> (i.e. it matches the main metadata fields).<br>
      <br>
      <strong>metadata</strong> is the default field which is used when no fields are specified. You can match more than one field at a time.
    <dt><strong>max(set)</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Changeset with highest revision number in set.
    <dt><strong>merge()</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Changeset is a merge changeset.
    <dt><strong>min(set)</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Changeset with lowest revision number in set.
    <dt><strong>modifies(pattern)</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Changesets modifying files matched by pattern.<br>
      <br>
      The pattern without explicit kind like <strong>glob:</strong> is expected to be relative to the current directory and match against a file or a directory.
    <dt><strong>named(namespace)</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>The changesets in a given namespace.<br>
      <br>
      If <em>namespace</em> starts with <em>re:</em>, the remainder of the string is treated as a regular expression. To match a namespace that actually starts with <em>re:</em>, use the prefix <em>literal:</em>.
    <dt><strong>obsolete()</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Mutable changeset with a newer version.
    <dt><strong>only(set, [set])</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Changesets that are ancestors of the first set that are not ancestors of any other head in the repo. If a second set is specified, the result is ancestors of the first set that are not ancestors of the second set (i.e. ::&lt;set1&gt; - ::&lt;set2&gt;).
    <dt><strong>origin([set])</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Changesets that were specified as a source for the grafts, transplants or rebases that created the given revisions. Omitting the optional set is the same as passing all(). If a changeset created by these operations is itself specified as a source for one of these operations, only the source changeset for the first operation is selected.
    <dt><strong>outgoing([path])</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Changesets not found in the specified destination repository, or the default push location.
    <dt><strong>p1([set])</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>First parent of changesets in set, or the working directory.
    <dt><strong>p2([set])</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Second parent of changesets in set, or the working directory.
    <dt><strong>parents([set])</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>The set of all parents for all changesets in set, or the working directory.
    <dt><strong>present(set)</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>An empty set, if any revision in set isn't found; otherwise, all revisions in set.<br>
      <br>
      If any of specified revisions is not present in the local repository, the query is normally aborted. But this predicate allows the query to continue even in such cases.
    <dt><strong>public()</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Changeset in public phase.
    <dt><strong>remote([id [,path]])</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Local revision that corresponds to the given identifier in a remote repository, if present. Here, the '.' identifier is a synonym for the current local branch.
    <dt><strong>removes(pattern)</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Changesets which remove files matching pattern.<br>
      <br>
      The pattern without explicit kind like <strong>glob:</strong> is expected to be relative to the current directory and match against a file or a directory.
    <dt><strong>rev(number)</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Revision with the given numeric identifier.
    <dt><strong>reverse(set)</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Reverse order of set.
    <dt><strong>roots(set)</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Changesets in set with no parent changeset in set.
    <dt><strong>secret()</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Changeset in secret phase.
    <dt><strong>sort(set[, [-]key... [, ...]])</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Sort set by keys. The default sort order is ascending, specify a key as <strong>-key</strong> to sort in descending order.<br>
      <br>
      The keys can be:
  </dl>
  <dl class="indent-2">
    <dt>·
    <dd>
      <p><strong>rev</strong> for the revision number,
    <dt>·
    <dd>
      <p><strong>branch</strong> for the branch name,
    <dt>·
    <dd>
      <p><strong>desc</strong> for the commit message (description),
    <dt>·
    <dd>
      <p><strong>user</strong> for user name (<strong>author</strong> can be used as an alias),
    <dt>·
    <dd>
      <p><strong>date</strong> for the commit date
    <dt>·
    <dd>
      <p><strong>topo</strong> for a reverse topographical sort<br>
      <br>
      The <strong>topo</strong> sort order cannot be combined with other sort keys. This sort takes one optional argument, <strong>topo.firstbranch</strong>, which takes a revset that specifies what topographical branches to prioritize in the sort.
    <dt><strong>subrepo([pattern])</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Changesets that add, modify or remove the given subrepo. If no subrepo pattern is named, any subrepo changes are returned.
    <dt><strong>tag([name])</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>The specified tag by name, or all tagged revisions if no name is given.<br>
      <br>
      If <em>name</em> starts with <em>re:</em>, the remainder of the name is treated as a regular expression. To match a tag that actually starts with <em>re:</em>, use the prefix <em>literal:</em>.
    <dt><strong>unstable()</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Non-obsolete changesets with obsolete ancestors.
    <dt><strong>user(string)</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>User name contains string. The match is case-insensitive.<br>
      <br>
      If <em>string</em> starts with <em>re:</em>, the remainder of the string is treated as a regular expression. To match a user that actually contains <em>re:</em>, use the prefix <em>literal:</em>.<br>
      <br>
      New predicates (known as “aliases”) can be defined, using any combination of existing predicates or other aliases. An alias definition looks like:<br>
      <br>
      <pre> &lt;alias&gt; = &lt;definition&gt;
</pre>
      <p>in the <strong>revsetalias</strong> section of a Mercurial configuration file. Arguments of the form <em>a1</em>, <em>a2</em>, etc. are substituted from the alias into the definition.<br>
      <br>
      For example,<br>
      <br>
      <pre> [revsetalias]
 h = heads()
 d(s) = sort(s, date)
 rs(s, k) = reverse(sort(s, k))
</pre>
      <p>defines three aliases, <strong>h</strong>, <strong>d</strong>, and <strong>rs</strong>. <strong>rs(0:tip, author)</strong> is exactly equivalent to <strong>reverse(sort(0:tip, author))</strong>.<br>
      <br>
      An infix operator <strong>##</strong> can concatenate strings and identifiers into one string. For example:<br>
      <br>
      <pre> [revsetalias]
 issue(a1) = grep(r'\bissue[ :]?' ## a1 ## r'\b|\bbug\(' ## a1 ## r'\)')
</pre>
      <p><strong>issue(1234)</strong> is equivalent to <strong>grep(r'\bissue[ :]?1234\b|\bbug\(1234\)')</strong> in this case. This matches against all of “issue 1234”, “issue:1234”, “issue1234” and “bug(1234)”.<br>
      <br>
      All other prefix, infix and postfix operators have lower priority than <strong>##</strong>. For example, <strong>a1 ## a2~2</strong> is equivalent to <strong>(a1 ## a2)~2</strong>.<br>
      <br>
      Command line equivalents for <strong>hg log</strong>:<br>
      <br>
      <pre> -f    -&gt;  ::.
 -d x  -&gt;  date(x)
 -k x  -&gt;  keyword(x)
 -m    -&gt;  merge()
 -u x  -&gt;  user(x)
 -b x  -&gt;  branch(x)
 -P x  -&gt;  !::x
 -l x  -&gt;  limit(expr, x)
</pre>
      <p>Some sample queries:
  </dl>
  <dl class="indent-2">
    <dt>·
    <dd>
      <p>Changesets on the default branch:<br>
      <br>

  <h2>USING MERCURIAL FROM SCRIPTS AND AUTOMATION</h2>
  <p>It is common for machines (as opposed to humans) to consume Mercurial. This help topic describes some of the considerations for interfacing machines with Mercurial.
  <div class="subsection">
    <h3>Choosing an Interface</h3>
    <p>Machines have a choice of several methods to interface with Mercurial. These include:
    <dl class="indent-2">
      <dt>·
      <dd>
        <p>Executing the <strong>hg</strong> process
      <dt>·
      <dd>
        <p>Querying a HTTP server
      <dt>·
      <dd>
        <p>Calling out to a command server<br>
        <br>
        Executing <strong>hg</strong> processes is very similar to how humans interact with Mercurial in the shell. It should already be familiar to you.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>hg serve</strong> can be used to start a server. By default, this will start a “hgweb” HTTP server. This HTTP server has support for machine-readable output, such as JSON. For more, see <strong>hg help hgweb</strong>.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>hg serve</strong> can also start a “command server.” Clients can connect to this server and issue Mercurial commands over a special protocol. For more details on the command server, including links to client libraries, see https://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/CommandServer.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>hg serve</strong> based interfaces (the hgweb and command servers) have the advantage over simple <strong>hg</strong> process invocations in that they are likely more efficient. This is because there is significant overhead to spawn new Python processes.
      <dt>Tip
      <dd>
        <p>If you need to invoke several <strong>hg</strong> processes in short order and/or performance is important to you, use of a server-based interface is highly recommended.
    </dl>
  </div>
  <div class="subsection">
    <h3>Environment Variables</h3>
    <p>As documented in <strong>hg help environment</strong>, various environment variables influence the operation of Mercurial. The following are particularly relevant for machines consuming Mercurial:
    <dl>
      <dt><strong>HGPLAIN</strong>
      <dd>
        <p>If not set, Mercurial's output could be influenced by configuration settings that impact its encoding, verbose mode, localization, etc.<br>
        <br>
        It is highly recommended for machines to set this variable when invoking <strong>hg</strong> processes.
      <dt><strong>HGENCODING</strong>
      <dd>
        <p>If not set, the locale used by Mercurial will be detected from the environment. If the determined locale does not support display of certain characters, Mercurial may render these character sequences incorrectly (often by using “?” as a placeholder for invalid characters in the current locale).<br>
        <br>
        Explicitly setting this environment variable is a good practice to guarantee consistent results. “utf-8” is a good choice on UNIX-like environments.
      <dt><strong>HGRCPATH</strong>
      <dd>
        <p>If not set, Mercurial will inherit config options from config files using the process described in <strong>hg help config</strong>. This includes inheriting user or system-wide config files.<br>
        <br>
        When utmost control over the Mercurial configuration is desired, the value of <strong>HGRCPATH</strong> can be set to an explicit file with known good configs. In rare cases, the value can be set to an empty file or the null device (often <strong>/dev/null</strong>) to bypass loading of any user or system config files. Note that these approaches can have unintended consequences, as the user and system config files often define things like the username and extensions that may be required to interface with a repository.
    </dl>
  </div>
  <div class="subsection">
    <h3>Consuming Command Output</h3>
    <p>It is common for machines to need to parse the output of Mercurial commands for relevant data. This section describes the various techniques for doing so.
  </div>
  <div class="subsection">
    <h3>Parsing Raw Command Output</h3>
    <p>Likely the simplest and most effective solution for consuming command output is to simply invoke <strong>hg</strong> commands as you would as a user and parse their output.<br>
    <br>
    The output of many commands can easily be parsed with tools like <strong>grep</strong>, <strong>sed</strong>, and <strong>awk</strong>.<br>
    <br>
    A potential downside with parsing command output is that the output of commands can change when Mercurial is upgraded. While Mercurial does generally strive for strong backwards compatibility, command output does occasionally change. Having tests for your automated interactions with <strong>hg</strong> commands is generally recommended, but is even more important when raw command output parsing is involved.
  </div>
  <div class="subsection">
    <h3>Using Templates to Control Output</h3>
    <p>Many <strong>hg</strong> commands support templatized output via the <strong>-T/--template</strong> argument. For more, see <strong>hg help templates</strong>.<br>
    <br>
    Templates are useful for explicitly controlling output so that you get exactly the data you want formatted how you want it. For example, <strong>log -T {node}\n</strong> can be used to print a newline delimited list of changeset nodes instead of a human-tailored output containing authors, dates, descriptions, etc.
    <dl>
      <dt>Tip
      <dd>
        <p>If parsing raw command output is too complicated, consider using templates to make your life easier.<br>
        <br>
        The <strong>-T/--template</strong> argument allows specifying pre-defined styles. Mercurial ships with the machine-readable styles <strong>json</strong> and <strong>xml</strong>, which provide JSON and XML output, respectively. These are useful for producing output that is machine readable as-is.
      <dt>Important
      <dd>
        <p>The <strong>json</strong> and <strong>xml</strong> styles are considered experimental. While they may be attractive to use for easily obtaining machine-readable output, their behavior may change in subsequent versions.<br>
        <br>
        These styles may also exhibit unexpected results when dealing with certain encodings. Mercurial treats things like filenames as a series of bytes and normalizing certain byte sequences to JSON or XML with certain encoding settings can lead to surprises.
    </dl>
  </div>
  <div class="subsection">
    <h3>Command Server Output</h3>
    <p>If using the command server to interact with Mercurial, you are likely using an existing library/API that abstracts implementation details of the command server. If so, this interface layer may perform parsing for you, saving you the work of implementing it yourself.
  </div>
  <div class="subsection">
    <h3>Output Verbosity</h3>
    <p>Commands often have varying output verbosity, even when machine readable styles are being used (e.g. <strong>-T json</strong>). Adding <strong>-v/--verbose</strong> and <strong>--debug</strong> to the command's arguments can increase the amount of data exposed by Mercurial.<br>
    <br>
    An alternate way to get the data you need is by explicitly specifying a template.
  </div>
  <div class="subsection">
    <h3>Other Topics</h3>
    <dl>
      <dt><strong>revsets</strong>
      <dd>
        <p>Revisions sets is a functional query language for selecting a set of revisions. Think of it as SQL for Mercurial repositories. Revsets are useful for querying repositories for specific data.<br>
        <br>
        See <strong>hg help revsets</strong> for more.
      <dt><strong>share extension</strong>
      <dd>
        <p>The <strong>share</strong> extension provides functionality for sharing repository data across several working copies. It can even automatically “pool” storage for logically related repositories when cloning.<br>
        <br>
        Configuring the <strong>share</strong> extension can lead to significant resource utilization reduction, particularly around disk space and the network. This is especially true for continuous integration (CI) environments.<br>
        <br>
        See <strong>hg help -e share</strong> for more.
    </dl>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <h2>SUBREPOSITORIES</h2>
  <p>Subrepositories let you nest external repositories or projects into a parent Mercurial repository, and make commands operate on them as a group.<br>
  <br>
  Mercurial currently supports Mercurial, Git, and Subversion subrepositories.<br>
  <br>
  Subrepositories are made of three components:
  <dl class="indent-3">
    <dt>1.
    <dd>
      <p>Nested repository checkouts. They can appear anywhere in the parent working directory.
    <dt>2.
    <dd>
      <p>Nested repository references. They are defined in <strong>.hgsub</strong>, which should be placed in the root of working directory, and tell where the subrepository checkouts come from. Mercurial subrepositories are referenced like:<br>
      <br>
      <pre> path/to/nested = https://example.com/nested/repo/path
</pre>
      <p>Git and Subversion subrepos are also supported:<br>
      <br>
      <pre> path/to/nested = [git]git://example.com/nested/repo/path
 path/to/nested = [svn]https://example.com/nested/trunk/path
</pre>
      <p>where <strong>path/to/nested</strong> is the checkout location relatively to the parent Mercurial root, and <strong>https://example.com/nested/repo/path</strong> is the source repository path. The source can also reference a filesystem path.<br>
      <br>
      Note that <strong>.hgsub</strong> does not exist by default in Mercurial repositories, you have to create and add it to the parent repository before using subrepositories.
    <dt>3.
    <dd>
      <p>Nested repository states. They are defined in <strong>.hgsubstate</strong>, which is placed in the root of working directory, and capture whatever information is required to restore the subrepositories to the state they were committed in a parent repository changeset. Mercurial automatically record the nested repositories states when committing in the parent repository.
    <dt>Note
    <dd>
      <p>The <strong>.hgsubstate</strong> file should not be edited manually.
  </dl>
  <div class="subsection">
    <h3>Adding a Subrepository</h3>
    <p>If <strong>.hgsub</strong> does not exist, create it and add it to the parent repository. Clone or checkout the external projects where you want it to live in the parent repository. Edit <strong>.hgsub</strong> and add the subrepository entry as described above. At this point, the subrepository is tracked and the next commit will record its state in <strong>.hgsubstate</strong> and bind it to the committed changeset.
  </div>
  <div class="subsection">
    <h3>Synchronizing a Subrepository</h3>
    <p>Subrepos do not automatically track the latest changeset of their sources. Instead, they are updated to the changeset that corresponds with the changeset checked out in the top-level changeset. This is so developers always get a consistent set of compatible code and libraries when they update.<br>
    <br>
    Thus, updating subrepos is a manual process. Simply check out target subrepo at the desired revision, test in the top-level repo, then commit in the parent repository to record the new combination.
  </div>
  <div class="subsection">
    <h3>Deleting a Subrepository</h3>
    <p>To remove a subrepository from the parent repository, delete its reference from <strong>.hgsub</strong>, then remove its files.
  </div>
  <div class="subsection">
    <h3>Interaction with Mercurial Commands</h3>
    <dl>
      <dt><strong>add</strong>
      <dd>
        <p>add does not recurse in subrepos unless -S/--subrepos is specified. However, if you specify the full path of a file in a subrepo, it will be added even without -S/--subrepos specified. Subversion subrepositories are currently silently ignored.
      <dt><strong>addremove</strong>
      <dd>
        <p>addremove does not recurse into subrepos unless -S/--subrepos is specified. However, if you specify the full path of a directory in a subrepo, addremove will be performed on it even without -S/--subrepos being specified. Git and Subversion subrepositories will print a warning and continue.
      <dt><strong>archive</strong>
      <dd>
        <p>archive does not recurse in subrepositories unless -S/--subrepos is specified.
      <dt><strong>cat</strong>
      <dd>
        <p>cat currently only handles exact file matches in subrepos. Subversion subrepositories are currently ignored.
      <dt><strong>commit</strong>
      <dd>
        <p>commit creates a consistent snapshot of the state of the entire project and its subrepositories. If any subrepositories have been modified, Mercurial will abort. Mercurial can be made to instead commit all modified subrepositories by specifying -S/--subrepos, or setting “ui.commitsubrepos=True” in a configuration file (see <strong>hg help config</strong>). After there are no longer any modified subrepositories, it records their state and finally commits it in the parent repository. The --addremove option also honors the -S/--subrepos option. However, Git and Subversion subrepositories will print a warning and abort.
      <dt><strong>diff</strong>
      <dd>
        <p>diff does not recurse in subrepos unless -S/--subrepos is specified. Changes are displayed as usual, on the subrepositories elements. Subversion subrepositories are currently silently ignored.
      <dt><strong>files</strong>
      <dd>
        <p>files does not recurse into subrepos unless -S/--subrepos is specified. However, if you specify the full path of a file or directory in a subrepo, it will be displayed even without -S/--subrepos being specified. Git and Subversion subrepositories are currently silently ignored.
      <dt><strong>forget</strong>
      <dd>
        <p>forget currently only handles exact file matches in subrepos. Git and Subversion subrepositories are currently silently ignored.
      <dt><strong>incoming</strong>
      <dd>
        <p>incoming does not recurse in subrepos unless -S/--subrepos is specified. Git and Subversion subrepositories are currently silently ignored.
      <dt><strong>outgoing</strong>
      <dd>
        <p>outgoing does not recurse in subrepos unless -S/--subrepos is specified. Git and Subversion subrepositories are currently silently ignored.
      <dt><strong>pull</strong>
      <dd>
        <p>pull is not recursive since it is not clear what to pull prior to running <strong>hg update</strong>. Listing and retrieving all subrepositories changes referenced by the parent repository pulled changesets is expensive at best, impossible in the Subversion case.
      <dt><strong>push</strong>
      <dd>
        <p>Mercurial will automatically push all subrepositories first when the parent repository is being pushed. This ensures new subrepository changes are available when referenced by top-level repositories. Push is a no-op for Subversion subrepositories.
      <dt><strong>status</strong>
      <dd>
        <p>status does not recurse into subrepositories unless -S/--subrepos is specified. Subrepository changes are displayed as regular Mercurial changes on the subrepository elements. Subversion subrepositories are currently silently ignored.
      <dt><strong>remove</strong>
      <dd>
        <p>remove does not recurse into subrepositories unless -S/--subrepos is specified. However, if you specify a file or directory path in a subrepo, it will be removed even without -S/--subrepos. Git and Subversion subrepositories are currently silently ignored.
      <dt><strong>update</strong>
      <dd>
        <p>update restores the subrepos in the state they were originally committed in target changeset. If the recorded changeset is not available in the current subrepository, Mercurial will pull it in first before updating. This means that updating can require network access when using subrepositories.
    </dl>
  </div>
  <div class="subsection">
    <h3>Remapping Subrepositories Sources</h3>
    <p>A subrepository source location may change during a project life, invalidating references stored in the parent repository history. To fix this, rewriting rules can be defined in parent repository <strong>hgrc</strong> file or in Mercurial configuration. See the <strong>[subpaths]</strong> section in hgrc(5) for more details.
  </div>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <h2>TEMPLATE USAGE</h2>
  <p>Mercurial allows you to customize output of commands through templates. You can either pass in a template or select an existing template-style from the command line, via the --template option.<br>
  <br>
  You can customize output for any “log-like” command: log, outgoing, incoming, tip, parents, and heads.<br>
  <br>
  Some built-in styles are packaged with Mercurial. These can be listed with <strong>hg log --template list</strong>. Example usage:<br>
  <br>
  <pre> $ hg log -r1.0::1.1 --template changelog
</pre>
  <p>A template is a piece of text, with markup to invoke variable expansion:<br>
  <br>
  <pre> $ hg log -r1 --template "{node}\n"
 b56ce7b07c52de7d5fd79fb89701ea538af65746
</pre>
  <p>Strings in curly braces are called keywords. The availability of keywords depends on the exact context of the templater. These keywords are usually available for templating a log-like command:
  <dl>
    <dt><strong>activebookmark</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>String. The active bookmark, if it is associated with the changeset
    <dt><strong>author</strong>

      The “date” keyword does not produce human-readable output. If you want to use a date in your output, you can use a filter to process it. Filters are functions which return a string based on the input variable. Be sure to use the stringify filter first when you're applying a string-input filter to a list-like input variable. You can also use a chain of filters to get the desired output:<br>
      <br>
      <pre> $ hg tip --template "{date|isodate}\n"
 2008-08-21 18:22 +0000
</pre>
      <p>List of filters:
    <dt><strong>addbreaks</strong>

    <dt><strong>basename</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Any text. Treats the text as a path, and returns the last component of the path after splitting by the path separator (ignoring trailing separators). For example, “foo/bar/baz” becomes “baz” and “foo/bar//” becomes “bar”.
    <dt><strong>count</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>List or text. Returns the length as an integer.
    <dt><strong>domain</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Any text. Finds the first string that looks like an email address, and extracts just the domain component. Example: <strong>User &lt;user@example.com&gt;</strong> becomes <strong>example.com</strong>.
    <dt><strong>email</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Any text. Extracts the first string that looks like an email address. Example: <strong>User &lt;user@example.com&gt;</strong> becomes <strong>user@example.com</strong>.

    <dt><strong>revescape</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Any text. Escapes all “special” characters, except @. Forward slashes are escaped twice to prevent web servers from prematurely unescaping them. For example, “@foo bar/baz” becomes “@foo%20bar%252Fbaz”.

    <dt><strong>stripdir</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Treat the text as path and strip a directory level, if possible. For example, “foo” and “foo/bar” becomes “foo”.
    <dt><strong>tabindent</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Any text. Returns the text, with every non-empty line except the first starting with a tab character.
    <dt><strong>upper</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Any text. Converts the text to uppercase.
    <dt><strong>urlescape</strong>

    <dt><strong>utf8</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Any text. Converts from the local character encoding to UTF-8.<br>
      <br>
      Note that a filter is nothing more than a function call, i.e. <strong>expr|filter</strong> is equivalent to <strong>filter(expr)</strong>.<br>
      <br>
      In addition to filters, there are some basic built-in functions:
    <dt><strong>date(date[, fmt])</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Format a date. See <strong>hg help dates</strong> for formatting strings. The default is a Unix date format, including the timezone: “Mon Sep 04 15:13:13 2006 0700”.
    <dt><strong>diff([includepattern [, excludepattern]])</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Show a diff, optionally specifying files to include or exclude.
    <dt><strong>fill(text[, width[, initialident[, hangindent]]])</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Fill many paragraphs with optional indentation. See the “fill” filter.
    <dt><strong>get(dict, key)</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Get an attribute/key from an object. Some keywords are complex types. This function allows you to obtain the value of an attribute on these types.
    <dt><strong>if(expr, then[, else])</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Conditionally execute based on the result of an expression.
    <dt><strong>ifcontains(search, thing, then[, else])</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Conditionally execute based on whether the item “search” is in “thing”.
    <dt><strong>ifeq(expr1, expr2, then[, else])</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Conditionally execute based on whether 2 items are equivalent.
    <dt><strong>indent(text, indentchars[, firstline])</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Indents all non-empty lines with the characters given in the indentchars string. An optional third parameter will override the indent for the first line only if present.
    <dt><strong>join(list, sep)</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Join items in a list with a delimiter.
    <dt><strong>label(label, expr)</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Apply a label to generated content. Content with a label applied can result in additional post-processing, such as automatic colorization.
    <dt><strong>latesttag([pattern])</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>The global tags matching the given pattern on the most recent globally tagged ancestor of this changeset.
    <dt><strong>localdate(date[, tz])</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Converts a date to the specified timezone. The default is local date.
    <dt><strong>pad(text, width[, fillchar=' '[, right=False]])</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Pad text with a fill character.
    <dt><strong>revset(query[, formatargs...])</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Execute a revision set query. See <strong>hg help revset</strong>.
    <dt><strong>rstdoc(text, style)</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Format ReStructuredText.
    <dt><strong>separate(sep, args)</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Add a separator between non-empty arguments.
    <dt><strong>shortest(node, minlength=4)</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Obtain the shortest representation of a node.
    <dt><strong>startswith(pattern, text)</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Returns the value from the “text” argument if it begins with the content from the “pattern” argument.
    <dt><strong>strip(text[, chars])</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Strip characters from a string. By default, strips all leading and trailing whitespace.
    <dt><strong>sub(pattern, replacement, expression)</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Perform text substitution using regular expressions.
    <dt><strong>word(number, text[, separator])</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Return the nth word from a string.<br>
      <br>
      Also, for any expression that returns a list, there is a list operator:<br>
      <br>
      <pre> expr % "{template}"
</pre>
      <p>As seen in the above example, <strong>{template}</strong> is interpreted as a template. To prevent it from being interpreted, you can use an escape character <strong>\{</strong> or a raw string prefix, <strong>r'...'</strong>.<br>
      <br>
      New keywords and functions can be defined in the <strong>templatealias</strong> section of a Mercurial configuration file:<br>
      <br>
      <pre> &lt;alias&gt; = &lt;definition&gt;
</pre>
      <p>Arguments of the form <em>a1</em>, <em>a2</em>, etc. are substituted from the alias into the definition.<br>
      <br>
      For example,<br>
      <br>
      <pre> [templatealias]
 r = rev
 rn = "{r}:{node|short}"
 leftpad(s, w) = pad(s, w, ' ', True)
</pre>
      <p>defines two symbol aliases, <strong>r</strong> and <strong>rn</strong>, and a function alias <strong>leftpad()</strong>.<br>

  <h2>URL PATHS</h2>
  <p>Valid URLs are of the form:<br>
  <br>
  <pre> local/filesystem/path[#revision]
 file://local/filesystem/path[#revision]
 http://[user[:pass]@]host[:port]/[path][#revision]
 https://[user[:pass]@]host[:port]/[path][#revision]
 ssh://[user@]host[:port]/[path][#revision]
</pre>
  <p>Paths in the local filesystem can either point to Mercurial repositories or to bundle files (as created by <strong>hg bundle</strong> or <strong>hg incoming --bundle</strong>). See also <strong>hg help paths</strong>.<br>
  <br>
  An optional identifier after # indicates a particular branch, tag, or changeset to use from the remote repository. See also <strong>hg help revisions</strong>.<br>
  <br>
  Some features, such as pushing to http:// and https:// URLs are only possible if the feature is explicitly enabled on the remote Mercurial server.<br>
  <br>
  Note that the security of HTTPS URLs depends on proper configuration of web.cacerts.<br>
  <br>
  Some notes about using SSH with Mercurial:
  <dl class="indent-2">
    <dt>·
    <dd>
      <p>SSH requires an accessible shell account on the destination machine and a copy of hg in the remote path or specified with as remotecmd.
    <dt>·
    <dd>
      <p>path is relative to the remote user's home directory by default. Use an extra slash at the start of a path to specify an absolute path:<br>
      <br>
      <pre> ssh://example.com//tmp/repository
</pre>
    <dt>·
    <dd>
      <p>Mercurial doesn't use its own compression via SSH; the right thing to do is to configure it in your ~/.ssh/config, e.g.:<br>
      <br>
      <pre> Host *.mylocalnetwork.example.com
   Compression no
 Host *
   Compression yes
</pre>
      <p>Alternatively specify “ssh -C” as your ssh command in your configuration file or with the --ssh command line option.<br>
      <br>
      These URLs can all be stored in your configuration file with path aliases under the [paths] section like so:<br>
      <br>
      <pre> [paths]
 alias1 = URL1
 alias2 = URL2
 ...
</pre>
      <p>You can then use the alias for any command that uses a URL (for example <strong>hg pull alias1</strong> will be treated as <strong>hg pull URL1</strong>).<br>
      <br>
      Two path aliases are special because they are used as defaults when you do not provide the URL to a command:
    <dt><strong>default:</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>When you create a repository with hg clone, the clone command saves the location of the source repository as the new repository's 'default' path. This is then used when you omit path from push- and pull-like commands (including incoming and outgoing).
    <dt><strong>default-push:</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>The push command will look for a path named 'default-push', and prefer it over 'default' if both are defined.
  </dl>

<div class="section">
  <h2>EXTENSIONS</h2>
  <p>This section contains help for extensions that are distributed together with Mercurial. Help for other extensions is available in the help system.
  <div class="subsection">
    <h3>acl</h3>
    <p>hooks for controlling repository access<br>
    <br>
    This hook makes it possible to allow or deny write access to given branches and paths of a repository when receiving incoming changesets via pretxnchangegroup and pretxncommit.<br>
    <br>
    The authorization is matched based on the local user name on the system where the hook runs, and not the committer of the original changeset (since the latter is merely informative).<br>
    <br>
    The acl hook is best used along with a restricted shell like hgsh, preventing authenticating users from doing anything other than pushing or pulling. The hook is not safe to use if users have interactive shell access, as they can then disable the hook. Nor is it safe if remote users share an account, because then there is no way to distinguish them.<br>
    <br>
    The order in which access checks are performed is:
    <dl class="indent-3">
      <dt>1.
      <dd>
        <p>Deny list for branches (section <strong>acl.deny.branches</strong>)
      <dt>2.
      <dd>
        <p>Allow list for branches (section <strong>acl.allow.branches</strong>)
      <dt>3.
      <dd>
        <p>Deny list for paths (section <strong>acl.deny</strong>)
      <dt>4.
      <dd>
        <p>Allow list for paths (section <strong>acl.allow</strong>)<br>
        <br>
        The allow and deny sections take key-value pairs.

    <p>Use the <strong>acl.deny.branches</strong> and <strong>acl.allow.branches</strong> sections to have branch-based access control. Keys in these sections can be either:
    <dl class="indent-2">
      <dt>·
      <dd>
        <p>a branch name, or
      <dt>·
      <dd>
        <p>an asterisk, to match any branch;<br>
        <br>
        The corresponding values can be either:
      <dt>·
      <dd>
        <p>a comma-separated list containing users and groups, or
      <dt>·
      <dd>
        <p>an asterisk, to match anyone;<br>
        <br>
        You can add the “!” prefix to a user or group name to invert the sense of the match.
    </dl>
  </div>
  <div class="subsection">
    <h3>Path-based Access Control</h3>
    <p>Use the <strong>acl.deny</strong> and <strong>acl.allow</strong> sections to have path-based access control. Keys in these sections accept a subtree pattern (with a glob syntax by default). The corresponding values follow the same syntax as the other sections above.
  </div>
  <div class="subsection">
    <h3>Groups</h3>
    <p>Group names must be prefixed with an <strong>@</strong> symbol. Specifying a group name has the same effect as specifying all the users in that group.<br>
    <br>
    You can define group members in the <strong>acl.groups</strong> section. If a group name is not defined there, and Mercurial is running under a Unix-like system, the list of users will be taken from the OS. Otherwise, an exception will be raised.

    <h3>Examples using the “!” prefix</h3>
    <p>Suppose there's a branch that only a given user (or group) should be able to push to, and you don't want to restrict access to any other branch that may be created.<br>
    <br>
    The “!” prefix allows you to prevent anyone except a given user or group to push changesets in a given branch or path.<br>
    <br>
    In the examples below, we will: 1) Deny access to branch “ring” to anyone but user “gollum” 2) Deny access to branch “lake” to anyone but members of the group “hobbit” 3) Deny access to a file to anyone but user “gollum”<br>

 # 2) only members of the group 'hobbit' can commit to branch 'lake';
 # 'hobbit' members and anyone else can still commit to any other branch.

    <h3>bugzilla</h3>
    <p>hooks for integrating with the Bugzilla bug tracker<br>
    <br>
    This hook extension adds comments on bugs in Bugzilla when changesets that refer to bugs by Bugzilla ID are seen. The comment is formatted using the Mercurial template mechanism.<br>
    <br>
    The bug references can optionally include an update for Bugzilla of the hours spent working on the bug. Bugs can also be marked fixed.<br>
    <br>
    Three basic modes of access to Bugzilla are provided:
    <dl class="indent-3">
      <dt>1.
      <dd>
        <p>Access via the Bugzilla XMLRPC interface. Requires Bugzilla 3.4 or later.
      <dt>2.
      <dd>
        <p>Check data via the Bugzilla XMLRPC interface and submit bug change via email to Bugzilla email interface. Requires Bugzilla 3.4 or later.
      <dt>3.
      <dd>
        <p>Writing directly to the Bugzilla database. Only Bugzilla installations using MySQL are supported. Requires Python MySQLdb.<br>
        <br>
        Writing directly to the database is susceptible to schema changes, and relies on a Bugzilla contrib script to send out bug change notification emails. This script runs as the user running Mercurial, must be run on the host with the Bugzilla install, and requires permission to read Bugzilla configuration details and the necessary MySQL user and password to have full access rights to the Bugzilla database. For these reasons this access mode is now considered deprecated, and will not be updated for new Bugzilla versions going forward. Only adding comments is supported in this access mode.<br>
        <br>
        Access via XMLRPC needs a Bugzilla username and password to be specified in the configuration. Comments are added under that username. Since the configuration must be readable by all Mercurial users, it is recommended that the rights of that user are restricted in Bugzilla to the minimum necessary to add comments. Marking bugs fixed requires Bugzilla 4.0 and later.<br>
        <br>
        Access via XMLRPC/email uses XMLRPC to query Bugzilla, but sends email to the Bugzilla email interface to submit comments to bugs. The From: address in the email is set to the email address of the Mercurial user, so the comment appears to come from the Mercurial user. In the event that the Mercurial user email is not recognized by Bugzilla as a Bugzilla user, the email associated with the Bugzilla username used to log into Bugzilla is used instead as the source of the comment. Marking bugs fixed works on all supported Bugzilla versions.<br>
        <br>
        Configuration items common to all access modes:
      <dt><strong>bugzilla.version</strong>

It must contain one “()” named group <strong>&lt;ids&gt;</strong> containing the bug IDs separated by non-digit characters. It may also contain a named group <strong>&lt;hours&gt;</strong> with a floating-point number giving the hours worked on the bug. If no named groups are present, the first “()” group is assumed to contain the bug IDs, and work time is not updated. The default expression matches <strong>Bug 1234</strong>, <strong>Bug no. 1234</strong>, <strong>Bug number 1234</strong>, <strong>Bugs 1234,5678</strong>, <strong>Bug 1234 and 5678</strong> and variations thereof, followed by an hours number prefixed by <strong>h</strong> or <strong>hours</strong>, e.g. <strong>hours 1.5</strong>.

    <h3>censor</h3>
    <p>erase file content at a given revision<br>
    <br>
    The censor command instructs Mercurial to erase all content of a file at a given revision <em>without updating the changeset hash.</em> This allows existing history to remain valid while preventing future clones/pulls from receiving the erased data.<br>
    <br>
    Typical uses for censor are due to security or legal requirements, including:<br>
    <br>
    <pre> * Passwords, private keys, cryptographic material
 * Licensed data/code/libraries for which the license has expired
 * Personally Identifiable Information or other private data
</pre>
    <p>Censored nodes can interrupt mercurial's typical operation whenever the excised data needs to be materialized. Some commands, like <strong>hg cat</strong>/<strong>hg revert</strong>, simply fail when asked to produce censored data. Others, like <strong>hg verify</strong> and <strong>hg update</strong>, must be capable of tolerating censored data to continue to function in a meaningful way. Such commands only tolerate censored file revisions if they are allowed by the “censor.policy=ignore” config option.

    <h3>clonebundles</h3>
    <p>advertise pre-generated bundles to seed clones<br>
    <br>
    “clonebundles” is a server-side extension used to advertise the existence of pre-generated, externally hosted bundle files to clients that are cloning so that cloning can be faster, more reliable, and require less resources on the server.<br>
    <br>
    Cloning can be a CPU and I/O intensive operation on servers. Traditionally, the server, in response to a client's request to clone, dynamically generates a bundle containing the entire repository content and sends it to the client. There is no caching on the server and the server will have to redundantly generate the same outgoing bundle in response to each clone request. For servers with large repositories or with high clone volume, the load from clones can make scaling the server challenging and costly.<br>
    <br>
    This extension provides server operators the ability to offload potentially expensive clone load to an external service. Here's how it works.
    <dl class="indent-3">
      <dt>1.
      <dd>
        <p>A server operator establishes a mechanism for making bundle files available on a hosting service where Mercurial clients can fetch them.
      <dt>2.
      <dd>
        <p>A manifest file listing available bundle URLs and some optional metadata is added to the Mercurial repository on the server.
      <dt>3.
      <dd>
        <p>A client initiates a clone against a clone bundles aware server.
      <dt>4.
      <dd>
        <p>The client sees the server is advertising clone bundles and fetches the manifest listing available bundles.
      <dt>5.
      <dd>
        <p>The client filters and sorts the available bundles based on what it supports and prefers.
      <dt>6.
      <dd>
        <p>The client downloads and applies an available bundle from the server-specified URL.
      <dt>7.
      <dd>
        <p>The client reconnects to the original server and performs the equivalent of <strong>hg pull</strong> to retrieve all repository data not in the bundle. (The repository could have been updated between when the bundle was created and when the client started the clone.)<br>
        <br>
        Instead of the server generating full repository bundles for every clone request, it generates full bundles once and they are subsequently reused to bootstrap new clones. The server may still transfer data at clone time. However, this is only data that has been added/changed since the bundle was created. For large, established repositories, this can reduce server load for clones to less than 1% of original.<br>
        <br>
        To work, this extension requires the following of server operators:
      <dt>·
      <dd>
        <p>Generating bundle files of repository content (typically periodically, such as once per day).
      <dt>·
      <dd>
        <p>A file server that clients have network access to and that Python knows how to talk to through its normal URL handling facility (typically an HTTP server).
      <dt>·
      <dd>
        <p>A process for keeping the bundles manifest in sync with available bundle files.<br>
        <br>
        Strictly speaking, using a static file hosting server isn't required: a server operator could use a dynamic service for retrieving bundle data. However, static file hosting services are simple and scalable and should be sufficient for most needs.<br>
        <br>
        Bundle files can be generated with the <strong>hg bundle</strong> command. Typically <strong>hg bundle --all</strong> is used to produce a bundle of the entire repository.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>hg debugcreatestreamclonebundle</strong> can be used to produce a special <em>streaming clone bundle</em>. These are bundle files that are extremely efficient to produce and consume (read: fast). However, they are larger than traditional bundle formats and require that clients support the exact set of repository data store formats in use by the repository that created them. Typically, a newer server can serve data that is compatible with older clients. However, <em>streaming clone bundles</em> don't have this guarantee. <strong>Server operators need to be aware that newer versions of Mercurial may produce streaming clone bundles incompatible with older Mercurial versions.</strong><br>
        <br>
        A server operator is responsible for creating a <strong>.hg/clonebundles.manifest</strong> file containing the list of available bundle files suitable for seeding clones. If this file does not exist, the repository will not advertise the existence of clone bundles when clients connect.<br>
        <br>
        The manifest file contains a newline ( ) delimited list of entries.<br>
        <br>
        Each line in this file defines an available bundle. Lines have the format:<br>
        <br>
        &lt;URL&gt; [&lt;key&gt;=&lt;value&gt;[ &lt;key&gt;=&lt;value&gt;]]<br>
        <br>
        That is, a URL followed by an optional, space-delimited list of key=value pairs describing additional properties of this bundle. Both keys and values are URI encoded.<br>
        <br>
        Keys in UPPERCASE are reserved for use by Mercurial and are defined below. All non-uppercase keys can be used by site installations. An example use for custom properties is to use the <em>datacenter</em> attribute to define which data center a file is hosted in. Clients could then prefer a server in the data center closest to them.<br>
        <br>
        The following reserved keys are currently defined:
      <dt><strong>BUNDLESPEC</strong>
      <dd>
        <p>A “bundle specification” string that describes the type of the bundle.<br>
        <br>
        These are string values that are accepted by the “--type” argument of <strong>hg bundle</strong>.<br>
        <br>
        The values are parsed in strict mode, which means they must be of the “&lt;compression&gt;-&lt;type&gt;” form. See mercurial.exchange.parsebundlespec() for more details.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>hg debugbundle --spec</strong> can be used to print the bundle specification string for a bundle file. The output of this command can be used verbatim for the value of <strong>BUNDLESPEC</strong> (it is already escaped).<br>
        <br>
        Clients will automatically filter out specifications that are unknown or unsupported so they won't attempt to download something that likely won't apply.<br>
        <br>
        The actual value doesn't impact client behavior beyond filtering: clients will still sniff the bundle type from the header of downloaded files.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Use of this key is highly recommended</strong>, as it allows clients to easily skip unsupported bundles. If this key is not defined, an old client may attempt to apply a bundle that it is incapable of reading.
      <dt><strong>REQUIRESNI</strong>
      <dd>
        <p>Whether Server Name Indication (SNI) is required to connect to the URL. SNI allows servers to use multiple certificates on the same IP. It is somewhat common in CDNs and other hosting providers. Older Python versions do not support SNI. Defining this attribute enables clients with older Python versions to filter this entry without experiencing an opaque SSL failure at connection time.<br>
        <br>
        If this is defined, it is important to advertise a non-SNI fallback URL or clients running old Python releases may not be able to clone with the clonebundles facility.<br>
        <br>
        Value should be “true”.<br>
        <br>
        Manifests can contain multiple entries. Assuming metadata is defined, clients will filter entries from the manifest that they don't support. The remaining entries are optionally sorted by client preferences (<strong>experimental.clonebundleprefers</strong> config option). The client then attempts to fetch the bundle at the first URL in the remaining list.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Errors when downloading a bundle will fail the entire clone operation: clients do not automatically fall back to a traditional clone.</strong> The reason for this is that if a server is using clone bundles, it is probably doing so because the feature is necessary to help it scale. In other words, there is an assumption that clone load will be offloaded to another service and that the Mercurial server isn't responsible for serving this clone load. If that other service experiences issues and clients start mass falling back to the original Mercurial server, the added clone load could overwhelm the server due to unexpected load and effectively take it offline. Not having clients automatically fall back to cloning from the original server mitigates this scenario.<br>
        <br>
        Because there is no automatic Mercurial server fallback on failure of the bundle hosting service, it is important for server operators to view the bundle hosting service as an extension of the Mercurial server in terms of availability and service level agreements: if the bundle hosting service goes down, so does the ability for clients to clone. Note: clients will see a message informing them how to bypass the clone bundles facility when a failure occurs. So server operators should prepare for some people to follow these instructions when a failure occurs, thus driving more load to the original Mercurial server when the bundle hosting service fails.

    <h3>color</h3>
    <p>colorize output from some commands<br>
    <br>
    The color extension colorizes output from several Mercurial commands. For example, the diff command shows additions in green and deletions in red, while the status command shows modified files in magenta. Many other commands have analogous colors. It is possible to customize these colors.
  </div>
  <div class="subsection">
    <h3>Effects</h3>
    <p>Other effects in addition to color, like bold and underlined text, are also available. By default, the terminfo database is used to find the terminal codes used to change color and effect. If terminfo is not available, then effects are rendered with the ECMA-48 SGR control function (aka ANSI escape codes).<br>
    <br>
    The available effects in terminfo mode are 'blink', 'bold', 'dim', 'inverse', 'invisible', 'italic', 'standout', and 'underline'; in ECMA-48 mode, the options are 'bold', 'inverse', 'italic', and 'underline'. How each is rendered depends on the terminal emulator. Some may not be available for a given terminal type, and will be silently ignored.
  </div>
  <div class="subsection">
    <h3>Labels</h3>
    <p>Text receives color effects depending on the labels that it has. Many default Mercurial commands emit labelled text. You can also define your own labels in templates using the label function, see <strong>hg help templates</strong>. A single portion of text may have more than one label. In that case, effects given to the last label will override any other effects. This includes the special “none” effect, which nullifies other effects.<br>
    <br>
    Labels are normally invisible. In order to see these labels and their position in the text, use the global --color=debug option. The same anchor text may be associated to multiple labels, e.g.<br>
    <br>
    [log.changeset changeset.secret|changeset: 22611:6f0a53c8f587]<br>
    <br>
    The following are the default effects for some default labels. Default effects may be overridden from your configuration file:<br>
    <br>
    <pre> [color]
 status.modified = blue bold underline red_background
 status.added = green bold
 status.removed = red bold blue_background
 status.deleted = cyan bold underline
 status.unknown = magenta bold underline
 status.ignored = black bold

 # 'none' turns off all effects
 status.clean = none
 status.copied = none

 qseries.applied = blue bold underline
 qseries.unapplied = black bold
 qseries.missing = red bold

 diff.diffline = bold
 diff.extended = cyan bold
 diff.file_a = red bold
 diff.file_b = green bold
 diff.hunk = magenta
 diff.deleted = red
 diff.inserted = green
 diff.changed = white
 diff.tab =
 diff.trailingwhitespace = bold red_background

 # Blank so it inherits the style of the surrounding label
 changeset.public =
 changeset.draft =
 changeset.secret =

 resolve.unresolved = red bold
 resolve.resolved = green bold

 bookmarks.active = green

 branches.active = none
 branches.closed = black bold
 branches.current = green
 branches.inactive = none

 tags.normal = green
 tags.local = black bold

 rebase.rebased = blue
 rebase.remaining = red bold

 shelve.age = cyan
 shelve.newest = green bold
 shelve.name = blue bold

 histedit.remaining = red bold
</pre>
  </div>
  <div class="subsection">
    <h3>Custom colors</h3>
    <p>Because there are only eight standard colors, this module allows you to define color names for other color slots which might be available for your terminal type, assuming terminfo mode. For instance:<br>
    <br>
    <pre> color.brightblue = 12
 color.pink = 207
 color.orange = 202
</pre>
    <p>to set 'brightblue' to color slot 12 (useful for 16 color terminals that have brighter colors defined in the upper eight) and, 'pink' and 'orange' to colors in 256-color xterm's default color cube. These defined colors may then be used as any of the pre-defined eight, including appending '_background' to set the background to that color.
  </div>
  <div class="subsection">
    <h3>Modes</h3>
    <p>By default, the color extension will use ANSI mode (or win32 mode on Windows) if it detects a terminal. To override auto mode (to enable terminfo mode, for example), set the following configuration option:<br>
    <br>
    <pre> [color]
 mode = terminfo
</pre>
    <p>Any value other than 'ansi', 'win32', 'terminfo', or 'auto' will disable color.<br>
    <br>
    Note that on some systems, terminfo mode may cause problems when using color with the pager extension and less -R. less with the -R option will only display ECMA-48 color codes, and terminfo mode may sometimes emit codes that less doesn't understand. You can work around this by either using ansi mode (or auto mode), or by using less -r (which will pass through all terminal control codes, not just color control codes).<br>
    <br>
    On some systems (such as MSYS in Windows), the terminal may support a different color mode than the pager (activated via the “pager” extension). It is possible to define separate modes depending on whether the pager is active:<br>
    <br>
    <pre> [color]
 mode = auto
 pagermode = ansi
</pre>
    <p>If <strong>pagermode</strong> is not defined, the <strong>mode</strong> will be used.

        <p>Subversion [svn] (history on branches is not preserved)<br>
        <br>
        If no revision is given, all revisions will be converted. Otherwise, convert will only import up to the named revision (given in a format understood by the source).<br>
        <br>
        If no destination directory name is specified, it defaults to the basename of the source with <strong>-hg</strong> appended. If the destination repository doesn't exist, it will be created.<br>
        <br>
        By default, all sources except Mercurial will use --branchsort. Mercurial uses --sourcesort to preserve original revision numbers order. Sort modes have the following effects:
      <dt><strong>--branchsort</strong>
      <dd>
        <p>convert from parent to child revision when possible, which means branches are usually converted one after the other. It generates more compact repositories.
      <dt><strong>--datesort</strong>
      <dd>
        <p>sort revisions by date. Converted repositories have good-looking changelogs but are often an order of magnitude larger than the same ones generated by --branchsort.
      <dt><strong>--sourcesort</strong>
      <dd>
        <p>try to preserve source revisions order, only supported by Mercurial sources.
      <dt><strong>--closesort</strong>
      <dd>
        <p>try to move closed revisions as close as possible to parent branches, only supported by Mercurial sources.<br>
        <br>
        If <strong>REVMAP</strong> isn't given, it will be put in a default location (<strong>&lt;dest&gt;/.hg/shamap</strong> by default). The <strong>REVMAP</strong> is a simple text file that maps each source commit ID to the destination ID for that revision, like so:<br>
        <br>
        <pre> &lt;source ID&gt; &lt;destination ID&gt;
</pre>
        <p>If the file doesn't exist, it's automatically created. It's updated on each commit copied, so <strong>hg convert</strong> can be interrupted and can be run repeatedly to copy new commits.<br>
        <br>
        The authormap is a simple text file that maps each source commit author to a destination commit author. It is handy for source SCMs that use unix logins to identify authors (e.g.: CVS). One line per author mapping and the line format is:<br>
        <br>
        <pre> source author = destination author
</pre>
        <p>Empty lines and lines starting with a <strong>#</strong> are ignored.<br>
        <br>
        The filemap is a file that allows filtering and remapping of files and directories. Each line can contain one of the following directives:<br>
        <br>
        <pre> include path/to/file-or-dir

 exclude path/to/file-or-dir

 rename path/to/source path/to/destination
</pre>
        <p>Comment lines start with <strong>#</strong>. A specified path matches if it equals the full relative name of a file or one of its parent directories. The <strong>include</strong> or <strong>exclude</strong> directive with the longest matching path applies, so line order does not matter.<br>
        <br>
        The <strong>include</strong> directive causes a file, or all files under a directory, to be included in the destination repository. The default if there are no <strong>include</strong> statements is to include everything. If there are any <strong>include</strong> statements, nothing else is included. The <strong>exclude</strong> directive causes files or directories to be omitted. The <strong>rename</strong> directive renames a file or directory if it is converted. To rename from a subdirectory into the root of the repository, use <strong>.</strong> as the path to rename to.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>--full</strong> will make sure the converted changesets contain exactly the right files with the right content. It will make a full conversion of all files, not just the ones that have changed. Files that already are correct will not be changed. This can be used to apply filemap changes when converting incrementally. This is currently only supported for Mercurial and Subversion.<br>
        <br>
        The splicemap is a file that allows insertion of synthetic history, letting you specify the parents of a revision. This is useful if you want to e.g. give a Subversion merge two parents, or graft two disconnected series of history together. Each entry contains a key, followed by a space, followed by one or two comma-separated values:<br>
        <br>
        <pre> key parent1, parent2
</pre>
        <p>The key is the revision ID in the source revision control system whose parents should be modified (same format as a key in .hg/shamap). The values are the revision IDs (in either the source or destination revision control system) that should be used as the new parents for that node. For example, if you have merged “release-1.0” into “trunk”, then you should specify the revision on “trunk” as the first parent and the one on the “release-1.0” branch as the second.<br>
        <br>
        The branchmap is a file that allows you to rename a branch when it is being brought in from whatever external repository. When used in conjunction with a splicemap, it allows for a powerful combination to help fix even the most badly mismanaged repositories and turn them into nicely structured Mercurial repositories. The branchmap contains lines of the form:<br>
        <br>
        <pre> original_branch_name new_branch_name
</pre>
        <p>where “original_branch_name” is the name of the branch in the source repository, and “new_branch_name” is the name of the branch is the destination repository. No whitespace is allowed in the branch names. This can be used to (for instance) move code in one repository from “default” to a named branch.

    <h3>CVS Source</h3>
    <p>CVS source will use a sandbox (i.e. a checked-out copy) from CVS to indicate the starting point of what will be converted. Direct access to the repository files is not needed, unless of course the repository is <strong>:local:</strong>. The conversion uses the top level directory in the sandbox to find the CVS repository, and then uses CVS rlog commands to find files to convert. This means that unless a filemap is given, all files under the starting directory will be converted, and that any directory reorganization in the CVS sandbox is ignored.<br>
    <br>
    The following options can be used with <strong>--config</strong>:
    <dl>
      <dt><strong>convert.cvsps.cache</strong>
      <dd>
        <p>Set to False to disable remote log caching, for testing and debugging purposes. Default is True.
      <dt><strong>convert.cvsps.fuzz</strong>
      <dd>
        <p>Specify the maximum time (in seconds) that is allowed between commits with identical user and log message in a single changeset. When very large files were checked in as part of a changeset then the default may not be long enough. The default is 60.
      <dt><strong>convert.cvsps.mergeto</strong>
      <dd>
        <p>Specify a regular expression to which commit log messages are matched. If a match occurs, then the conversion process will insert a dummy revision merging the branch on which this log message occurs to the branch indicated in the regex. Default is <strong>{{mergetobranch ([-\w]+)}}</strong>
      <dt><strong>convert.cvsps.mergefrom</strong>
      <dd>
        <p>Specify a regular expression to which commit log messages are matched. If a match occurs, then the conversion process will add the most recent revision on the branch indicated in the regex as the second parent of the changeset. Default is <strong>{{mergefrombranch ([-\w]+)}}</strong>
      <dt><strong>convert.localtimezone</strong>
      <dd>
        <p>use local time (as determined by the TZ environment variable) for changeset date/times. The default is False (use UTC).
      <dt><strong>hooks.cvslog</strong>
      <dd>
        <p>Specify a Python function to be called at the end of gathering the CVS log. The function is passed a list with the log entries, and can modify the entries in-place, or add or delete them.
      <dt><strong>hooks.cvschangesets</strong>
      <dd>
        <p>Specify a Python function to be called after the changesets are calculated from the CVS log. The function is passed a list with the changeset entries, and can modify the changesets in-place, or add or delete them.<br>
        <br>
        An additional “debugcvsps” Mercurial command allows the builtin changeset merging code to be run without doing a conversion. Its parameters and output are similar to that of cvsps 2.1. Please see the command help for more details.

    <h3>Subversion Source</h3>
    <p>Subversion source detects classical trunk/branches/tags layouts. By default, the supplied <strong>svn://repo/path/</strong> source URL is converted as a single branch. If <strong>svn://repo/path/trunk</strong> exists it replaces the default branch. If <strong>svn://repo/path/branches</strong> exists, its subdirectories are listed as possible branches. If <strong>svn://repo/path/tags</strong> exists, it is looked for tags referencing converted branches. Default <strong>trunk</strong>, <strong>branches</strong> and <strong>tags</strong> values can be overridden with following options. Set them to paths relative to the source URL, or leave them blank to disable auto detection.<br>
    <br>
    The following options can be set with <strong>--config</strong>:
    <dl>
      <dt><strong>convert.svn.branches</strong>
      <dd>
        <p>specify the directory containing branches. The default is <strong>branches</strong>.
      <dt><strong>convert.svn.tags</strong>
      <dd>
        <p>specify the directory containing tags. The default is <strong>tags</strong>.
      <dt><strong>convert.svn.trunk</strong>
      <dd>
        <p>specify the name of the trunk branch. The default is <strong>trunk</strong>.
      <dt><strong>convert.localtimezone</strong>
      <dd>
        <p>use local time (as determined by the TZ environment variable) for changeset date/times. The default is False (use UTC).<br>
        <br>
        Source history can be retrieved starting at a specific revision, instead of being integrally converted. Only single branch conversions are supported.
      <dt><strong>convert.svn.startrev</strong>

    <h3>Git Source</h3>
    <p>The Git importer converts commits from all reachable branches (refs in refs/heads) and remotes (refs in refs/remotes) to Mercurial. Branches are converted to bookmarks with the same name, with the leading 'refs/heads' stripped. Git submodules are converted to Git subrepos in Mercurial.<br>
    <br>
    The following options can be set with <strong>--config</strong>:
    <dl>
      <dt><strong>convert.git.similarity</strong>
      <dd>
        <p>specify how similar files modified in a commit must be to be imported as renames or copies, as a percentage between <strong>0</strong> (disabled) and <strong>100</strong> (files must be identical). For example, <strong>90</strong> means that a delete/add pair will be imported as a rename if more than 90% of the file hasn't changed. The default is <strong>50</strong>.
      <dt><strong>convert.git.findcopiesharder</strong>
      <dd>
        <p>while detecting copies, look at all files in the working copy instead of just changed ones. This is very expensive for large projects, and is only effective when <strong>convert.git.similarity</strong> is greater than 0. The default is False.
      <dt><strong>convert.git.remoteprefix</strong>
      <dd>
        <p>remote refs are converted as bookmarks with <strong>convert.git.remoteprefix</strong> as a prefix followed by a /. The default is 'remote'.
      <dt><strong>convert.git.skipsubmodules</strong>
      <dd>
        <p>does not convert root level .gitmodules files or files with 160000 mode indicating a submodule. Default is False.

  <div class="subsection">
    <h3>Perforce Source</h3>
    <p>The Perforce (P4) importer can be given a p4 depot path or a client specification as source. It will convert all files in the source to a flat Mercurial repository, ignoring labels, branches and integrations. Note that when a depot path is given you then usually should specify a target directory, because otherwise the target may be named <strong>...-hg</strong>.<br>
    <br>
    The following options can be set with <strong>--config</strong>:
    <dl>
      <dt><strong>convert.p4.encoding</strong>
      <dd>
        <p>specify the encoding to use when decoding standard output of the Perforce command line tool. The default is default system encoding.
      <dt><strong>convert.p4.startrev</strong>
      <dd>
        <p>specify initial Perforce revision (a Perforce changelist number).

    <h3>Mercurial Destination</h3>
    <p>The Mercurial destination will recognize Mercurial subrepositories in the destination directory, and update the .hgsubstate file automatically if the destination subrepositories contain the &lt;dest&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;/.hg/shamap file. Converting a repository with subrepositories requires converting a single repository at a time, from the bottom up.<br>
    <br>
    An example showing how to convert a repository with subrepositories:<br>
    <br>
    <pre> # so convert knows the type when it sees a non empty destination

    <h3>eol</h3>
    <p>automatically manage newlines in repository files<br>
    <br>
    This extension allows you to manage the type of line endings (CRLF or LF) that are used in the repository and in the local working directory. That way you can get CRLF line endings on Windows and LF on Unix/Mac, thereby letting everybody use their OS native line endings.<br>
    <br>
    The extension reads its configuration from a versioned <strong>.hgeol</strong> configuration file found in the root of the working directory. The <strong>.hgeol</strong> file use the same syntax as all other Mercurial configuration files. It uses two sections, <strong>[patterns]</strong> and <strong>[repository]</strong>.<br>
    <br>
    The <strong>[patterns]</strong> section specifies how line endings should be converted between the working directory and the repository. The format is specified by a file pattern. The first match is used, so put more specific patterns first. The available line endings are <strong>LF</strong>, <strong>CRLF</strong>, and <strong>BIN</strong>.<br>
    <br>
    Files with the declared format of <strong>CRLF</strong> or <strong>LF</strong> are always checked out and stored in the repository in that format and files declared to be binary (<strong>BIN</strong>) are left unchanged. Additionally, <strong>native</strong> is an alias for checking out in the platform's default line ending: <strong>LF</strong> on Unix (including Mac OS X) and <strong>CRLF</strong> on Windows. Note that <strong>BIN</strong> (do nothing to line endings) is Mercurial's default behavior; it is only needed if you need to override a later, more general pattern.<br>
    <br>
    The optional <strong>[repository]</strong> section specifies the line endings to use for files stored in the repository. It has a single setting, <strong>native</strong>, which determines the storage line endings for files declared as <strong>native</strong> in the <strong>[patterns]</strong> section. It can be set to <strong>LF</strong> or <strong>CRLF</strong>. The default is <strong>LF</strong>. For example, this means that on Windows, files configured as <strong>native</strong> (<strong>CRLF</strong> by default) will be converted to <strong>LF</strong> when stored in the repository. Files declared as <strong>LF</strong>, <strong>CRLF</strong>, or <strong>BIN</strong> in the <strong>[patterns]</strong> section are always stored as-is in the repository.<br>
    <br>
    Example versioned <strong>.hgeol</strong> file:<br>
    <br>
    <pre> [patterns]
 **.py = native
 **.vcproj = CRLF
 **.txt = native
 Makefile = LF
 **.jpg = BIN

 [repository]
 native = LF
</pre>
    <dl class="indent-2">
      <dt>Note
      <dd>
        <p>The rules will first apply when files are touched in the working directory, e.g. by updating to null and back to tip to touch all files.<br>
        <br>
        The extension uses an optional <strong>[eol]</strong> section read from both the normal Mercurial configuration files and the <strong>.hgeol</strong> file, with the latter overriding the former. You can use that section to control the overall behavior. There are three settings:
      <dt>·
      <dd>
        <p><strong>eol.native</strong> (default <strong>os.linesep</strong>) can be set to <strong>LF</strong> or <strong>CRLF</strong> to override the default interpretation of <strong>native</strong> for checkout. This can be used with <strong>hg archive</strong> on Unix, say, to generate an archive where files have line endings for Windows.
      <dt>·
      <dd>
        <p><strong>eol.only-consistent</strong> (default True) can be set to False to make the extension convert files with inconsistent EOLs. Inconsistent means that there is both <strong>CRLF</strong> and <strong>LF</strong> present in the file. Such files are normally not touched under the assumption that they have mixed EOLs on purpose.
      <dt>·
      <dd>
        <p><strong>eol.fix-trailing-newline</strong> (default False) can be set to True to ensure that converted files end with a EOL character (either <strong>\n</strong> or <strong>\r\n</strong> as per the configured patterns).<br>
        <br>
        The extension provides <strong>cleverencode:</strong> and <strong>cleverdecode:</strong> filters like the deprecated win32text extension does. This means that you can disable win32text and enable eol and your filters will still work. You only need to these filters until you have prepared a <strong>.hgeol</strong> file.<br>
        <br>
        The <strong>win32text.forbid*</strong> hooks provided by the win32text extension have been unified into a single hook named <strong>eol.checkheadshook</strong>. The hook will lookup the expected line endings from the <strong>.hgeol</strong> file, which means you must migrate to a <strong>.hgeol</strong> file first before using the hook. <strong>eol.checkheadshook</strong> only checks heads, intermediate invalid revisions will be pushed. To forbid them completely, use the <strong>eol.checkallhook</strong> hook. These hooks are best used as <strong>pretxnchangegroup</strong> hooks.<br>
        <br>
        See <strong>hg help patterns</strong> for more information about the glob patterns used.

    <h3>extdiff</h3>
    <p>command to allow external programs to compare revisions<br>
    <br>
    The extdiff Mercurial extension allows you to use external programs to compare revisions, or revision with working directory. The external diff programs are called with a configurable set of options and two non-option arguments: paths to directories containing snapshots of files to compare.<br>
    <br>
    The extdiff extension also allows you to configure new diff commands, so you do not need to type <strong>hg extdiff -p kdiff3</strong> always.<br>
    <br>
    <pre> [extdiff]
 # add new command that runs GNU diff(1) in 'context diff' mode
 cdiff = gdiff -Nprc5
 ## or the old way:
 #cmd.cdiff = gdiff
 #opts.cdiff = -Nprc5

 # add new command called meld, runs meld (no need to name twice).  If
 # the meld executable is not available, the meld tool in [merge-tools]
 # will be used, if available
 meld =

 # add new command called vimdiff, runs gvimdiff with DirDiff plugin
 # (see http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=102) Non
 # English user, be sure to put "let g:DirDiffDynamicDiffText = 1" in
 # your .vimrc
 vimdiff = gvim -f "+next" \
           "+execute 'DirDiff' fnameescape(argv(0)) fnameescape(argv(1))"
</pre>
    <p>Tool arguments can include variables that are expanded at runtime:<br>
    <br>
    <pre> $parent1, $plabel1 - filename, descriptive label of first parent
 $child,   $clabel  - filename, descriptive label of child revision
 $parent2, $plabel2 - filename, descriptive label of second parent
 $root              - repository root
 $parent is an alias for $parent1.
</pre>
    <p>The extdiff extension will look in your [diff-tools] and [merge-tools] sections for diff tool arguments, when none are specified in [extdiff].<br>
    <br>
    <pre> [extdiff]
 kdiff3 =

 [diff-tools]
 kdiff3.diffargs=--L1 '$plabel1' --L2 '$clabel' $parent $child
</pre>
    <p>You can use -I/-X and list of file or directory names like normal <strong>hg diff</strong> command. The extdiff extension makes snapshots of only needed files, so running the external diff program will actually be pretty fast (at least faster than having to compare the entire tree).

    <h3>fsmonitor</h3>
    <p>Faster status operations with the Watchman file monitor (EXPERIMENTAL)<br>

    Integrates the file-watching program Watchman with Mercurial to produce faster status results.<br>
    <br>
    On a particular Linux system, for a real-world repository with over 400,000 files hosted on ext4, vanilla <em>hg status</em> takes 1.3 seconds. On the same system, with fsmonitor it takes about 0.3 seconds.<br>
    <br>
    fsmonitor requires no configuration -- it will tell Watchman about your repository as necessary. You'll need to install Watchman from https://facebook.github.io/watchman/ and make sure it is in your PATH.<br>

    <br>
    <pre> [fsmonitor]

 walk_on_invalidate = (boolean)
</pre>
    <p>Whether or not to walk the whole repo ourselves when our cached state has been invalidated, for example when Watchman has been restarted or .hgignore rules have been changed. Walking the repo in that case can result in competing for I/O with Watchman. For large repos it is recommended to set this value to false. You may wish to set this to true if you have a very fast filesystem that can outpace the IPC overhead of getting the result data for the full repo from Watchman. Defaults to false.<br>
    <br>
    fsmonitor is incompatible with the largefiles and eol extensions, and will disable itself if any of those are active.

    <h3>hgk</h3>
    <p>browse the repository in a graphical way<br>
    <br>
    The hgk extension allows browsing the history of a repository in a graphical way. It requires Tcl/Tk version 8.4 or later. (Tcl/Tk is not distributed with Mercurial.)<br>
    <br>
    hgk consists of two parts: a Tcl script that does the displaying and querying of information, and an extension to Mercurial named hgk.py, which provides hooks for hgk to get information. hgk can be found in the contrib directory, and the extension is shipped in the hgext repository, and needs to be enabled.<br>
    <br>
    The <strong>hg view</strong> command will launch the hgk Tcl script. For this command to work, hgk must be in your search path. Alternately, you can specify the path to hgk in your configuration file:<br>
    <br>
    <pre> [hgk]
 path = /location/of/hgk
</pre>
    <p>hgk can make use of the extdiff extension to visualize revisions. Assuming you had already configured extdiff vdiff command, just add:<br>
    <br>
    <pre> [hgk]
 vdiff=vdiff
</pre>
    <p>Revisions context menu will now display additional entries to fire vdiff on hovered and selected revisions.

    There are the following configuration options:<br>
    <br>
    <pre> [web]

</pre>
    <p><strong>highlightonlymatchfilename</strong> will only highlight files if their type could be identified by their filename. When this is not enabled (the default), Pygments will try very hard to identify the file type from content and any match (even matches with a low confidence score) will be used.

    <h3>histedit</h3>
    <p>interactive history editing<br>
    <br>
    With this extension installed, Mercurial gains one new command: histedit. Usage is as follows, assuming the following history:<br>
    <br>
    <pre> @  3[tip]   7c2fd3b9020c   2009-04-27 18:04 -0500   durin42

 o  0   d8d2fcd0e319   2009-04-27 18:04 -0500   durin42
      Add alpha
</pre>
    <p>If you were to run <strong>hg histedit c561b4e977df</strong>, you would see the following file open in your editor:<br>
    <br>
    <pre> pick c561b4e977df Add beta
 pick 030b686bedc4 Add gamma
 pick 7c2fd3b9020c Add delta

 # Edit history between c561b4e977df and 7c2fd3b9020c
 #
 # Commits are listed from least to most recent
 #
 # Commands:
 #  p, pick = use commit
 #  e, edit = use commit, but stop for amending
 #  f, fold = use commit, but combine it with the one above
 #  r, roll = like fold, but discard this commit's description
 #  d, drop = remove commit from history
 #  m, mess = edit commit message without changing commit content
 #
</pre>
    <p>In this file, lines beginning with <strong>#</strong> are ignored. You must specify a rule for each revision in your history. For example, if you had meant to add gamma before beta, and then wanted to add delta in the same revision as beta, you would reorganize the file to look like this:<br>
    <br>
    <pre> pick 030b686bedc4 Add gamma
 pick c561b4e977df Add beta
 fold 7c2fd3b9020c Add delta

 # Edit history between c561b4e977df and 7c2fd3b9020c
 #
 # Commits are listed from least to most recent
 #
 # Commands:
 #  p, pick = use commit
 #  e, edit = use commit, but stop for amending
 #  f, fold = use commit, but combine it with the one above
 #  r, roll = like fold, but discard this commit's description
 #  d, drop = remove commit from history
 #  m, mess = edit commit message without changing commit content
 #
</pre>
    <p>At which point you close the editor and <strong>histedit</strong> starts working. When you specify a <strong>fold</strong> operation, <strong>histedit</strong> will open an editor when it folds those revisions together, offering you a chance to clean up the commit message:<br>
    <br>
    <pre> Add beta
 ***
 Add delta
</pre>
    <p>Edit the commit message to your liking, then close the editor. For this example, let's assume that the commit message was changed to <strong>Add beta and delta.</strong> After histedit has run and had a chance to remove any old or temporary revisions it needed, the history looks like this:<br>
    <br>
    <pre> @  2[tip]   989b4d060121   2009-04-27 18:04 -0500   durin42
 |    Add beta and delta.

 o  0   d8d2fcd0e319   2009-04-27 18:04 -0500   durin42
      Add alpha
</pre>
    <p>Note that <strong>histedit</strong> does <em>not</em> remove any revisions (even its own temporary ones) until after it has completed all the editing operations, so it will probably perform several strip operations when it's done. For the above example, it had to run strip twice. Strip can be slow depending on a variety of factors, so you might need to be a little patient. You can choose to keep the original revisions by passing the <strong>--keep</strong> flag.<br>
    <br>
    The <strong>edit</strong> operation will drop you back to a command prompt, allowing you to edit files freely, or even use <strong>hg record</strong> to commit some changes as a separate commit. When you're done, any remaining uncommitted changes will be committed as well. When done, run <strong>hg histedit --continue</strong> to finish this step. You'll be prompted for a new commit message, but the default commit message will be the original message for the <strong>edit</strong> ed revision.<br>
    <br>
    The <strong>message</strong> operation will give you a chance to revise a commit message without changing the contents. It's a shortcut for doing <strong>edit</strong> immediately followed by <em>hg histedit --continue`</em>.<br>
    <br>
    If <strong>histedit</strong> encounters a conflict when moving a revision (while handling <strong>pick</strong> or <strong>fold</strong>), it'll stop in a similar manner to <strong>edit</strong> with the difference that it won't prompt you for a commit message when done. If you decide at this point that you don't like how much work it will be to rearrange history, or that you made a mistake, you can use <strong>hg histedit --abort</strong> to abandon the new changes you have made and return to the state before you attempted to edit your history.<br>
    <br>
    If we clone the histedit-ed example repository above and add four more changes, such that we have the following history:<br>
    <br>

    <p>If you run <strong>hg histedit --outgoing</strong> on the clone then it is the same as running <strong>hg histedit 836302820282</strong>. If you need plan to push to a repository that Mercurial does not detect to be related to the source repo, you can add a <strong>--force</strong> option.

    <h3>Config</h3>
    <p>Histedit rule lines are truncated to 80 characters by default. You can customize this behavior by setting a different length in your configuration file:<br>
    <br>
    <pre> [histedit]
 linelen = 120      # truncate rule lines at 120 characters
</pre>
    <p><strong>hg histedit</strong> attempts to automatically choose an appropriate base revision to use. To change which base revision is used, define a revset in your configuration file:<br>
    <br>
    <pre> [histedit]
 defaultrev = only(.) & draft()
</pre>
    <p>By default each edited revision needs to be present in histedit commands. To remove revision you need to use <strong>drop</strong> operation. You can configure the drop to be implicit for missing commits by adding:<br>

    <pre> hg histedit [OPTIONS] ([ANCESTOR] | --outgoing [URL])

    <p>This command lets you edit a linear series of changesets (up to and including the working directory, which should be clean). You can:
    <dl class="indent-2">
      <dt>·
      <dd>
        <p><em>pick</em> to [re]order a changeset
      <dt>·

        <p><em>drop</em> to omit changeset
      <dt>·
      <dd>
        <p><em>mess</em> to reword the changeset commit message
      <dt>·
      <dd>
        <p><em>fold</em> to combine it with the preceding changeset
      <dt>·
      <dd>
        <p><em>roll</em> like fold, but discarding this commit's description
      <dt>·
      <dd>
        <p><em>edit</em> to edit this changeset<br>
        <br>
        There are a number of ways to select the root changeset:
      <dt>·
      <dd>
        <p>Specify ANCESTOR directly
      <dt>·
      <dd>
        <p>Use --outgoing -- it will be the first linear changeset not included in destination. (See <strong>hg help config.paths.default-push</strong>)
      <dt>·
      <dd>
        <p>Otherwise, the value from the “histedit.defaultrev” config option is used as a revset to select the base revision when ANCESTOR is not specified. The first revision returned by the revset is used. By default, this selects the editable history that is unique to the ancestry of the working directory.<br>
        <br>
        If you use --outgoing, this command will abort if there are ambiguous outgoing revisions. For example, if there are multiple branches containing outgoing revisions.<br>
        <br>
        Use “min(outgoing() and ::.)” or similar revset specification instead of --outgoing to specify edit target revision exactly in such ambiguous situation. See <strong>hg help revsets</strong> for detail about selecting revisions.<br>
        <br>
        Examples:
      <dt>·
      <dd>
        <p>A number of changes have been made. Revision 3 is no longer needed.<br>

    <h3>keyword</h3>
    <p>expand keywords in tracked files<br>
    <br>
    This extension expands RCS/CVS-like or self-customized $Keywords$ in tracked text files selected by your configuration.<br>
    <br>
    Keywords are only expanded in local repositories and not stored in the change history. The mechanism can be regarded as a convenience for the current user or for archive distribution.<br>
    <br>
    Keywords expand to the changeset data pertaining to the latest change relative to the working directory parent of each file.<br>
    <br>
    Configuration is done in the [keyword], [keywordset] and [keywordmaps] sections of hgrc files.<br>
    <br>
    Example:<br>
    <br>
    <pre> [keyword]
 # expand keywords in every python file except those matching "x*"
 **.py =
 x*    = ignore

 [keywordset]
 # prefer svn- over cvs-like default keywordmaps
 svn = True
</pre>
    <dl>
      <dt>Note
      <dd>
        <p>The more specific you are in your filename patterns the less you lose speed in huge repositories.<br>
        <br>
        For [keywordmaps] template mapping and expansion demonstration and control run <strong>hg kwdemo</strong>. See <strong>hg help templates</strong> for a list of available templates and filters.<br>
        <br>
        Three additional date template filters are provided:
      <dt><strong>utcdate</strong>
      <dd>
        <p>“2006/09/18 15:13:13”
      <dt><strong>svnutcdate</strong>
      <dd>
        <p>“2006-09-18 15:13:13Z”
      <dt><strong>svnisodate</strong>
      <dd>
        <p>“2006-09-18 08:13:13 -700 (Mon, 18 Sep 2006)”<br>
        <br>
        The default template mappings (view with <strong>hg kwdemo -d</strong>) can be replaced with customized keywords and templates. Again, run <strong>hg kwdemo</strong> to control the results of your configuration changes.<br>
        <br>
        Before changing/disabling active keywords, you must run <strong>hg kwshrink</strong> to avoid storing expanded keywords in the change history.<br>
        <br>
        To force expansion after enabling it, or a configuration change, run <strong>hg kwexpand</strong>.<br>
        <br>
        Expansions spanning more than one line and incremental expansions, like CVS' $Log$, are not supported. A keyword template map “Log = {desc}” expands to the first line of the changeset description.

    <h3>largefiles</h3>
    <p>track large binary files<br>
    <br>
    Large binary files tend to be not very compressible, not very diffable, and not at all mergeable. Such files are not handled efficiently by Mercurial's storage format (revlog), which is based on compressed binary deltas; storing large binary files as regular Mercurial files wastes bandwidth and disk space and increases Mercurial's memory usage. The largefiles extension addresses these problems by adding a centralized client-server layer on top of Mercurial: largefiles live in a <em>central store</em> out on the network somewhere, and you only fetch the revisions that you need when you need them.<br>
    <br>
    largefiles works by maintaining a “standin file” in .hglf/ for each largefile. The standins are small (41 bytes: an SHA-1 hash plus newline) and are tracked by Mercurial. Largefile revisions are identified by the SHA-1 hash of their contents, which is written to the standin. largefiles uses that revision ID to get/put largefile revisions from/to the central store. This saves both disk space and bandwidth, since you don't need to retrieve all historical revisions of large files when you clone or pull.<br>
    <br>
    To start a new repository or add new large binary files, just add --large to your <strong>hg add</strong> command. For example:<br>
    <br>
    <pre> $ dd if=/dev/urandom of=randomdata count=2000
 $ hg add --large randomdata
 $ hg commit -m "add randomdata as a largefile"
</pre>
    <p>When you push a changeset that adds/modifies largefiles to a remote repository, its largefile revisions will be uploaded along with it. Note that the remote Mercurial must also have the largefiles extension enabled for this to work.<br>
    <br>
    When you pull a changeset that affects largefiles from a remote repository, the largefiles for the changeset will by default not be pulled down. However, when you update to such a revision, any largefiles needed by that revision are downloaded and cached (if they have never been downloaded before). One way to pull largefiles when pulling is thus to use --update, which will update your working copy to the latest pulled revision (and thereby downloading any new largefiles).<br>
    <br>
    If you want to pull largefiles you don't need for update yet, then you can use pull with the <em>--lfrev</em> option or the <strong>hg lfpull</strong> command.<br>
    <br>
    If you know you are pulling from a non-default location and want to download all the largefiles that correspond to the new changesets at the same time, then you can pull with <em>--lfrev “pulled()”</em>.<br>
    <br>
    If you just want to ensure that you will have the largefiles needed to merge or rebase with new heads that you are pulling, then you can pull with <em>--lfrev “head(pulled())”</em> flag to pre-emptively download any largefiles that are new in the heads you are pulling.<br>
    <br>
    Keep in mind that network access may now be required to update to changesets that you have not previously updated to. The nature of the largefiles extension means that updating is no longer guaranteed to be a local-only operation.<br>
    <br>
    If you already have large files tracked by Mercurial without the largefiles extension, you will need to convert your repository in order to benefit from largefiles. This is done with the <strong>hg lfconvert</strong> command:<br>
    <br>
    <pre> $ hg lfconvert --size 10 oldrepo newrepo
</pre>
    <p>In repositories that already have largefiles in them, any new file over 10MB will automatically be added as a largefile. To change this threshold, set <strong>largefiles.minsize</strong> in your Mercurial config file to the minimum size in megabytes to track as a largefile, or use the --lfsize option to the add command (also in megabytes):<br>
    <br>
    <pre> [largefiles]
 minsize = 2

 $ hg add --lfsize 2
</pre>
    <p>The <strong>largefiles.patterns</strong> config option allows you to specify a list of filename patterns (see <strong>hg help patterns</strong>) that should always be tracked as largefiles:<br>
    <br>
    <pre> [largefiles]
 patterns =
   *.jpg
   re:.*\.(png|bmp)$
   library.zip
   content/audio/*
</pre>
    <p>Files that match one of these patterns will be added as largefiles regardless of their size.<br>
    <br>
    The <strong>largefiles.minsize</strong> and <strong>largefiles.patterns</strong> config options will be ignored for any repositories not already containing a largefile. To add the first largefile to a repository, you must explicitly do so with the --large flag passed to the <strong>hg add</strong> command.

    <h3>lfconvert</h3>
    <p>convert a normal repository to a largefiles repository:<br>
    <br>
    <pre> hg lfconvert SOURCE DEST [FILE ...]
</pre>
    <p>Convert repository SOURCE to a new repository DEST, identical to SOURCE except that certain files will be converted as largefiles: specifically, any file that matches any PATTERN <em>or</em> whose size is above the minimum size threshold is converted as a largefile. The size used to determine whether or not to track a file as a largefile is the size of the first version of the file. The minimum size can be specified either with --size or in configuration as <strong>largefiles.size</strong>.<br>
    <br>
    After running this command you will need to make sure that largefiles is enabled anywhere you intend to push the new repository.<br>
    <br>
    Use --to-normal to convert largefiles back to normal files; after this, the DEST repository can be used without largefiles at all.<br>

    <h3>logtoprocess</h3>
    <p>Send ui.log() data to a subprocess (EXPERIMENTAL)<br>
    <br>
    This extension lets you specify a shell command per ui.log() event, sending all remaining arguments to as environment variables to that command.<br>
    <br>
    Each positional argument to the method results in a <em>MSG[N]</em> key in the environment, starting at 1 (so <em>MSG1</em>, <em>MSG2</em>, etc.). Each keyword argument is set as a <em>OPT_UPPERCASE_KEY</em> variable (so the key is uppercased, and prefixed with <em>OPT_</em>). The original event name is passed in the <em>EVENT</em> environment variable, and the process ID of mercurial is given in <em>HGPID</em>.<br>
    <br>
    So given a call <em>ui.log('foo', 'bar', 'baz', spam='eggs'), a script configured for the `foo</em> event can expect an environment with <em>MSG1=bar</em>, <em>MSG2=baz</em>, and <em>OPT_SPAM=eggs</em>.<br>
    <br>
    Scripts are configured in the <em>[logtoprocess]</em> section, each key an event name. For example:<br>
    <br>
    <pre> [logtoprocess]
 commandexception = echo "$MSG2$MSG3" &gt; /var/log/mercurial_exceptions.log
</pre>
    <p>would log the warning message and traceback of any failed command dispatch.<br>

    Scripts are run asychronously as detached daemon processes; mercurial will not ensure that they exit cleanly.

  <div class="subsection">
    <h3>mq</h3>
    <p>manage a stack of patches<br>
    <br>
    This extension lets you work with a stack of patches in a Mercurial repository. It manages two stacks of patches - all known patches, and applied patches (subset of known patches).<br>
    <br>
    Known patches are represented as patch files in the .hg/patches directory. Applied patches are both patch files and changesets.<br>
    <br>
    Common tasks (use <strong>hg help command</strong> for more details):<br>
    <br>
    <pre> create new patch                          qnew
 import existing patch                     qimport

 print patch series                        qseries
 print applied patches                     qapplied

 add known patch to applied stack          qpush
 remove patch from applied stack           qpop
 refresh contents of top applied patch     qrefresh
</pre>
    <p>By default, mq will automatically use git patches when required to avoid losing file mode changes, copy records, binary files or empty files creations or deletions. This behavior can be configured with:<br>
    <br>
    <pre> [mq]
 git = auto/keep/yes/no
</pre>
    <p>If set to 'keep', mq will obey the [diff] section configuration while preserving existing git patches upon qrefresh. If set to 'yes' or 'no', mq will override the [diff] section and always generate git or regular patches, possibly losing data in the second case.<br>
    <br>
    It may be desirable for mq changesets to be kept in the secret phase (see <strong>hg help phases</strong>), which can be enabled with the following setting:<br>
    <br>
    <pre> [mq]
 secret = True
</pre>
    <p>You will by default be managing a patch queue named “patches”. You can create other, independent patch queues with the <strong>hg qqueue</strong> command.<br>
    <br>
    If the working directory contains uncommitted files, qpush, qpop and qgoto abort immediately. If -f/--force is used, the changes are discarded. Setting:<br>
    <br>
    <pre> [mq]
 keepchanges = True
</pre>
    <p>make them behave as if --keep-changes were passed, and non-conflicting local changes will be tolerated and preserved. If incompatible options such as -f/--force or --exact are passed, this setting is ignored.<br>
    <br>
    This extension used to provide a strip command. This command now lives in the strip extension.

    With -f/--force, an existing patch of the same name will be overwritten.<br>
    <br>
    An existing changeset may be placed under mq control with -r/--rev (e.g. qimport --rev . -n patch will place the current revision under mq control). With -g/--git, patches imported with --rev will use the git diff format. See the diffs help topic for information on why this is important for preserving rename/copy information and permission changes. Use <strong>hg qfinish</strong> to remove changesets from mq control.<br>

    <p>qnew creates a new patch on top of the currently-applied patch (if any). The patch will be initialized with any outstanding changes in the working directory. You may also use -I/--include, -X/--exclude, and/or a list of files after the patch name to add only changes to matching files to the new patch, leaving the rest as uncommitted modifications.<br>
    <br>
    -u/--user and -d/--date can be used to set the (given) user and date, respectively. -U/--currentuser and -D/--currentdate set user to current user and date to current date.<br>
    <br>
    -e/--edit, -m/--message or -l/--logfile set the patch header as well as the commit message. If none is specified, the header is empty and the commit message is '[mq]: PATCH'.<br>

    <h3>qselect</h3>
    <p>set or print guarded patches to push:<br>
    <br>
    <pre> hg qselect [OPTION]... [GUARD]...
</pre>
    <p>Use the <strong>hg qguard</strong> command to set or print guards on patch, then use qselect to tell mq which guards to use. A patch will be pushed if it has no guards or any positive guards match the currently selected guard, but will not be pushed if any negative guards match the current guard. For example:<br>
    <br>
    <pre> qguard foo.patch -- -stable    (negative guard)
 qguard bar.patch    +stable    (positive guard)
 qselect stable
</pre>
    <p>This activates the “stable” guard. mq will skip foo.patch (because it has a negative match) but push bar.patch (because it has a positive match).<br>
    <br>
    With no arguments, prints the currently active guards. With one argument, sets the active guard.<br>
    <br>
    Use -n/--none to deactivate guards (no other arguments needed). When no guards are active, patches with positive guards are skipped and patches with negative guards are pushed.<br>
    <br>
    qselect can change the guards on applied patches. It does not pop guarded patches by default. Use --pop to pop back to the last applied patch that is not guarded. Use --reapply (which implies --pop) to push back to the current patch afterwards, but skip guarded patches.<br>
    <br>
    Use -s/--series to print a list of all guards in the series file (no other arguments needed). Use -v for more information.<br>

    Returns 0 on success.<br>

    <h3>notify</h3>
    <p>hooks for sending email push notifications<br>
    <br>
    This extension implements hooks to send email notifications when changesets are sent from or received by the local repository.<br>
    <br>
    First, enable the extension as explained in <strong>hg help extensions</strong>, and register the hook you want to run. <strong>incoming</strong> and <strong>changegroup</strong> hooks are run when changesets are received, while <strong>outgoing</strong> hooks are for changesets sent to another repository:<br>
    <br>
    <pre> [hooks]
 # one email for each incoming changeset
 incoming.notify = python:hgext.notify.hook
 # one email for all incoming changesets
 changegroup.notify = python:hgext.notify.hook

 # one email for all outgoing changesets
 outgoing.notify = python:hgext.notify.hook
</pre>
    <p>This registers the hooks. To enable notification, subscribers must be assigned to repositories. The <strong>[usersubs]</strong> section maps multiple repositories to a given recipient. The <strong>[reposubs]</strong> section maps multiple recipients to a single repository:<br>
    <br>
    <pre> [usersubs]
 # key is subscriber email, value is a comma-separated list of repo patterns
 user@host = pattern

 [reposubs]
 # key is repo pattern, value is a comma-separated list of subscriber emails
 pattern = user@host
</pre>
    <p>A <strong>pattern</strong> is a <strong>glob</strong> matching the absolute path to a repository, optionally combined with a revset expression. A revset expression, if present, is separated from the glob by a hash. Example:<br>
    <br>
    <pre> [reposubs]
 */widgets#branch(release) = qa-team@example.com
</pre>
    <p>This sends to <strong>qa-team@example.com</strong> whenever a changeset on the <strong>release</strong> branch triggers a notification in any repository ending in <strong>widgets</strong>.<br>
    <br>
    In order to place them under direct user management, <strong>[usersubs]</strong> and <strong>[reposubs]</strong> sections may be placed in a separate <strong>hgrc</strong> file and incorporated by reference:<br>
    <br>
    <pre> [notify]
 config = /path/to/subscriptionsfile
</pre>
    <p>Notifications will not be sent until the <strong>notify.test</strong> value is set to <strong>False</strong>; see below.<br>
    <br>
    Notifications content can be tweaked with the following configuration entries:
    <dl>
      <dt><strong>notify.test</strong>
      <dd>
        <p>If <strong>True</strong>, print messages to stdout instead of sending them. Default: True.
      <dt><strong>notify.sources</strong>
      <dd>
        <p>Space-separated list of change sources. Notifications are activated only when a changeset's source is in this list. Sources may be:
      <dt><strong>serve</strong>
      <dd>
        <p>changesets received via http or ssh
      <dt><strong>pull</strong>
      <dd>
        <p>changesets received via <strong>hg pull</strong>
      <dt><strong>unbundle</strong>
      <dd>
        <p>changesets received via <strong>hg unbundle</strong>
      <dt><strong>push</strong>
      <dd>
        <p>changesets sent or received via <strong>hg push</strong>
      <dt><strong>bundle</strong>
      <dd>
        <p>changesets sent via <strong>hg unbundle</strong><br>
        <br>
        Default: serve.
      <dt><strong>notify.strip</strong>
      <dd>
        <p>Number of leading slashes to strip from url paths. By default, notifications reference repositories with their absolute path. <strong>notify.strip</strong> lets you turn them into relative paths. For example, <strong>notify.strip=3</strong> will change <strong>/long/path/repository</strong> into <strong>repository</strong>. Default: 0.
      <dt><strong>notify.domain</strong>
      <dd>
        <p>Default email domain for sender or recipients with no explicit domain.
      <dt><strong>notify.style</strong>
      <dd>
        <p>Style file to use when formatting emails.
      <dt><strong>notify.template</strong>
      <dd>
        <p>Template to use when formatting emails.
      <dt><strong>notify.incoming</strong>
      <dd>
        <p>Template to use when run as an incoming hook, overriding <strong>notify.template</strong>.
      <dt><strong>notify.outgoing</strong>
      <dd>
        <p>Template to use when run as an outgoing hook, overriding <strong>notify.template</strong>.
      <dt><strong>notify.changegroup</strong>
      <dd>
        <p>Template to use when running as a changegroup hook, overriding <strong>notify.template</strong>.
      <dt><strong>notify.maxdiff</strong>
      <dd>
        <p>Maximum number of diff lines to include in notification email. Set to 0 to disable the diff, or -1 to include all of it. Default: 300.
      <dt><strong>notify.maxsubject</strong>
      <dd>
        <p>Maximum number of characters in email's subject line. Default: 67.
      <dt><strong>notify.diffstat</strong>
      <dd>
        <p>Set to True to include a diffstat before diff content. Default: True.
      <dt><strong>notify.merge</strong>
      <dd>
        <p>If True, send notifications for merge changesets. Default: True.
      <dt><strong>notify.mbox</strong>
      <dd>
        <p>If set, append mails to this mbox file instead of sending. Default: None.
      <dt><strong>notify.fromauthor</strong>
      <dd>
        <p>If set, use the committer of the first changeset in a changegroup for the “From” field of the notification mail. If not set, take the user from the pushing repo. Default: False.<br>
        <br>
        If set, the following entries will also be used to customize the notifications:
      <dt><strong>email.from</strong>
      <dd>
        <p>Email <strong>From</strong> address to use if none can be found in the generated email content.
      <dt><strong>web.baseurl</strong>
      <dd>
        <p>Root repository URL to combine with repository paths when making references. See also <strong>notify.strip</strong>.

    <h3>pager</h3>
    <p>browse command output with an external pager<br>
    <br>
    To set the pager that should be used, set the application variable:<br>
    <br>
    <pre> [pager]
 pager = less -FRX
</pre>
    <p>If no pager is set, the pager extensions uses the environment variable $PAGER. If neither pager.pager, nor $PAGER is set, no pager is used.<br>
    <br>
    You can disable the pager for certain commands by adding them to the pager.ignore list:<br>
    <br>
    <pre> [pager]
 ignore = version, help, update
</pre>
    <p>You can also enable the pager only for certain commands using pager.attend. Below is the default list of commands to be paged:<br>
    <br>
    <pre> [pager]
 attend = annotate, cat, diff, export, glog, log, qdiff
</pre>
    <p>Setting pager.attend to an empty value will cause all commands to be paged.<br>
    <br>
    If pager.attend is present, pager.ignore will be ignored.<br>
    <br>
    Lastly, you can enable and disable paging for individual commands with the attend-&lt;command&gt; option. This setting takes precedence over existing attend and ignore options and defaults:<br>
    <br>
    <pre> [pager]
 attend-cat = false
</pre>
    <p>To ignore global commands like <strong>hg version</strong> or <strong>hg help</strong>, you have to specify them in your user configuration file.<br>
    <br>
    To control whether the pager is used at all for an individual command, you can use --pager=&lt;value&gt;:<br>
    <br>
    <pre> - use as needed: `auto`.
 - require the pager: `yes` or `on`.
 - suppress the pager: `no` or `off` (any unrecognized value
 will also work).
</pre>

    <h3>patchbomb</h3>
    <p>command to send changesets as (a series of) patch emails<br>
    <br>
    The series is started off with a “[PATCH 0 of N]” introduction, which describes the series as a whole.<br>
    <br>
    Each patch email has a Subject line of “[PATCH M of N] ...”, using the first line of the changeset description as the subject text. The message contains two or three body parts:
    <dl class="indent-2">
      <dt>·
      <dd>
        <p>The changeset description.
      <dt>·
      <dd>
        <p>[Optional] The result of running diffstat on the patch.
      <dt>·
      <dd>
        <p>The patch itself, as generated by <strong>hg export</strong>.<br>
        <br>
        Each message refers to the first in the series using the In-Reply-To and References headers, so they will show up as a sequence in threaded mail and news readers, and in mail archives.<br>
        <br>
        To configure other defaults, add a section like this to your configuration file:<br>
        <br>
        <pre> [email]
 from = My Name &lt;my@email&gt;
 to = recipient1, recipient2, ...
 cc = cc1, cc2, ...
 bcc = bcc1, bcc2, ...
 reply-to = address1, address2, ...
</pre>
        <p>Use <strong>[patchbomb]</strong> as configuration section name if you need to override global <strong>[email]</strong> address settings.<br>
        <br>
        Then you can use the <strong>hg email</strong> command to mail a series of changesets as a patchbomb.<br>
        <br>
        You can also either configure the method option in the email section to be a sendmail compatible mailer or fill out the [smtp] section so that the patchbomb extension can automatically send patchbombs directly from the commandline. See the [email] and [smtp] sections in hgrc(5) for details.<br>
        <br>
        By default, <strong>hg email</strong> will prompt for a <strong>To</strong> or <strong>CC</strong> header if you do not supply one via configuration or the command line. You can override this to never prompt by configuring an empty value:<br>
        <br>
        <pre> [email]
 cc =
</pre>
        <p>You can control the default inclusion of an introduction message with the <strong>patchbomb.intro</strong> configuration option. The configuration is always overwritten by command line flags like --intro and --desc:<br>
        <br>
        <pre> [patchbomb]
 intro=auto   # include introduction message if more than 1 patch (default)
 intro=never  # never include an introduction message
 intro=always # always include an introduction message
</pre>
        <p>You can set patchbomb to always ask for confirmation by setting <strong>patchbomb.confirm</strong> to true.

    <h3>Commands</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="subsection">
    <h3>email</h3>
    <p>send changesets by email:<br>
    <br>
    <pre> hg email [OPTION]... [DEST]...
</pre>
    <p>By default, diffs are sent in the format generated by <strong>hg export</strong>, one per message. The series starts with a “[PATCH 0 of N]” introduction, which describes the series as a whole.<br>
    <br>
    Each patch email has a Subject line of “[PATCH M of N] ...”, using the first line of the changeset description as the subject text. The message contains two or three parts. First, the changeset description.<br>
    <br>
    With the -d/--diffstat option, if the diffstat program is installed, the result of running diffstat on the patch is inserted.<br>
    <br>
    Finally, the patch itself, as generated by <strong>hg export</strong>.<br>
    <br>
    With the -d/--diffstat or --confirm options, you will be presented with a final summary of all messages and asked for confirmation before the messages are sent.<br>
    <br>
    By default the patch is included as text in the email body for easy reviewing. Using the -a/--attach option will instead create an attachment for the patch. With -i/--inline an inline attachment will be created. You can include a patch both as text in the email body and as a regular or an inline attachment by combining the -a/--attach or -i/--inline with the --body option.<br>
    <br>
    With -o/--outgoing, emails will be generated for patches not found in the destination repository (or only those which are ancestors of the specified revisions if any are provided)<br>
    <br>
    With -b/--bundle, changesets are selected as for --outgoing, but a single email containing a binary Mercurial bundle as an attachment will be sent. Use the <strong>patchbomb.bundletype</strong> config option to control the bundle type as with <strong>hg bundle --type</strong>.<br>
    <br>
    With -m/--mbox, instead of previewing each patchbomb message in a pager or sending the messages directly, it will create a UNIX mailbox file with the patch emails. This mailbox file can be previewed with any mail user agent which supports UNIX mbox files.<br>
    <br>
    With -n/--test, all steps will run, but mail will not be sent. You will be prompted for an email recipient address, a subject and an introductory message describing the patches of your patchbomb. Then when all is done, patchbomb messages are displayed. If the PAGER environment variable is set, your pager will be fired up once for each patchbomb message, so you can verify everything is alright.<br>
    <br>
    In case email sending fails, you will find a backup of your series introductory message in <strong>.hg/last-email.txt</strong>.<br>
    <br>
    The default behavior of this command can be customized through configuration. (See <strong>hg help patchbomb</strong> for details)<br>
    <br>
    Examples:<br>
    <br>
    <pre> hg email -r 3000          # send patch 3000 only
 hg email -r 3000 -r 3001  # send patches 3000 and 3001
 hg email -r 3000:3005     # send patches 3000 through 3005
 hg email 3000             # send patch 3000 (deprecated)

 hg email -o               # send all patches not in default
 hg email -o DEST          # send all patches not in DEST
 hg email -o -r 3000       # send all ancestors of 3000 not in default
 hg email -o -r 3000 DEST  # send all ancestors of 3000 not in DEST

 hg email -b               # send bundle of all patches not in default
 hg email -b DEST          # send bundle of all patches not in DEST
 hg email -b -r 3000       # bundle of all ancestors of 3000 not in default
 hg email -b -r 3000 DEST  # bundle of all ancestors of 3000 not in DEST

 hg email -o -m mbox &amp;&    # generate an mbox file...
   mutt -R -f mbox         # ... and view it with mutt
 hg email -o -m mbox &amp;&    # generate an mbox file ...
   formail -s sendmail \   # ... and use formail to send from the mbox
     -bm -t &lt; mbox         # ... using sendmail
</pre>
    <p>Before using this command, you will need to enable email in your hgrc. See the [email] section in hgrc(5) for details.<br>

    <h3>purge</h3>
    <p>removes files not tracked by Mercurial:<br>
    <br>
    <pre> hg purge [OPTION]... [DIR]...
</pre>
    <p>Delete files not known to Mercurial. This is useful to test local and uncommitted changes in an otherwise-clean source tree.<br>
    <br>
    This means that purge will delete the following by default:
    <dl class="indent-2">
      <dt>·
      <dd>
        <p>Unknown files: files marked with “?” by <strong>hg status</strong>
      <dt>·
      <dd>
        <p>Empty directories: in fact Mercurial ignores directories unless they contain files under source control management<br>
        <br>
        But it will leave untouched:
      <dt>·
      <dd>
        <p>Modified and unmodified tracked files
      <dt>·
      <dd>
        <p>Ignored files (unless --all is specified)
      <dt>·
      <dd>
        <p>New files added to the repository (with <strong>hg add</strong>)<br>
        <br>
        The --files and --dirs options can be used to direct purge to delete only files, only directories, or both. If neither option is given, both will be deleted.<br>
        <br>
        If directories are given on the command line, only files in these directories are considered.<br>
        <br>
        Be careful with purge, as you could irreversibly delete some files you forgot to add to the repository. If you only want to print the list of files that this program would delete, use the --print option.<br>
        <br>
        Options:
      <dt><strong>-a, --abort-on-err</strong>
      <dd>
        <p>abort if an error occurs
      <dt><strong>--all</strong>
      <dd>
        <p>purge ignored files too
      <dt><strong>--dirs</strong>
      <dd>
        <p>purge empty directories
      <dt><strong>--files</strong>
      <dd>
        <p>purge files

    <h3>rebase</h3>
    <p>command to move sets of revisions to a different ancestor<br>
    <br>
    This extension lets you rebase changesets in an existing Mercurial repository.<br>
    <br>
    For more information: https://mercurial-scm.org/wiki/RebaseExtension
  </div>
  <div class="subsection">
    <h3>Commands</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="subsection">
    <h3>rebase</h3>
    <p>move changeset (and descendants) to a different branch:<br>
    <br>
    <pre> hg rebase [-s REV | -b REV] [-d REV] [OPTION]
</pre>
    <p>Rebase uses repeated merging to graft changesets from one part of history (the source) onto another (the destination). This can be useful for linearizing <em>local</em> changes relative to a master development tree.<br>
    <br>
    Published commits cannot be rebased (see <strong>hg help phases</strong>). To copy commits, see <strong>hg help graft</strong>.<br>
    <br>
    If you don't specify a destination changeset (<strong>-d/--dest</strong>), rebase will use the same logic as <strong>hg merge</strong> to pick a destination. if the current branch contains exactly one other head, the other head is merged with by default. Otherwise, an explicit revision with which to merge with must be provided. (destination changeset is not modified by rebasing, but new changesets are added as its descendants.)<br>
    <br>
    Here are the ways to select changesets:
    <dl class="indent-3">
      <dt>1.
      <dd>
        <p>Explicitly select them using <strong>--rev</strong>.
      <dt>2.
      <dd>
        <p>Use <strong>--source</strong> to select a root changeset and include all of its descendants.
      <dt>3.
      <dd>
        <p>Use <strong>--base</strong> to select a changeset; rebase will find ancestors and their descendants which are not also ancestors of the destination.
      <dt>4.
      <dd>
        <p>If you do not specify any of <strong>--rev</strong>, <strong>source</strong>, or <strong>--base</strong>, rebase will use <strong>--base .</strong> as above.<br>
        <br>
        Rebase will destroy original changesets unless you use <strong>--keep</strong>. It will also move your bookmarks (even if you do).<br>
        <br>
        Some changesets may be dropped if they do not contribute changes (e.g. merges from the destination branch).<br>
        <br>
        Unlike <strong>merge</strong>, rebase will do nothing if you are at the branch tip of a named branch with two heads. You will need to explicitly specify source and/or destination.<br>
        <br>
        If you need to use a tool to automate merge/conflict decisions, you can specify one with <strong>--tool</strong>, see <strong>hg help merge-tools</strong>. As a caveat: the tool will not be used to mediate when a file was deleted, there is no hook presently available for this.<br>
        <br>
        If a rebase is interrupted to manually resolve a conflict, it can be continued with --continue/-c or aborted with --abort/-a.<br>
        <br>
        Examples:
      <dt>·
      <dd>
        <p>move “local changes” (current commit back to branching point) to the current branch tip after a pull:<br>
        <br>
        <pre> hg rebase
</pre>
      <dt>·
      <dd>
        <p>move a single changeset to the stable branch:<br>
        <br>
        <pre> hg rebase -r 5f493448 -d stable
</pre>
      <dt>·
      <dd>
        <p>splice a commit and all its descendants onto another part of history:<br>
        <br>
        <pre> hg rebase --source c0c3 --dest 4cf9
</pre>
      <dt>·
      <dd>
        <p>rebase everything on a branch marked by a bookmark onto the default branch:<br>
        <br>
        <pre> hg rebase --base myfeature --dest default
</pre>
      <dt>·
      <dd>
        <p>collapse a sequence of changes into a single commit:<br>
        <br>
        <pre> hg rebase --collapse -r 1520:1525 -d .
</pre>
      <dt>·
      <dd>
        <p>move a named branch while preserving its name:<br>
        <br>
        <pre> hg rebase -r "branch(featureX)" -d 1.3 --keepbranches
</pre>
        <p>Returns 0 on success, 1 if nothing to rebase or there are unresolved conflicts.<br>

  <div class="subsection">
    <h3>Commands</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="subsection">
    <h3>relink</h3>
    <p>recreate hardlinks between two repositories:<br>
    <br>
    <pre> hg relink [ORIGIN]
</pre>
    <p>When repositories are cloned locally, their data files will be hardlinked so that they only use the space of a single repository.<br>
    <br>
    Unfortunately, subsequent pulls into either repository will break hardlinks for any files touched by the new changesets, even if both repositories end up pulling the same changes.<br>
    <br>
    Similarly, passing --rev to “hg clone” will fail to use any hardlinks, falling back to a complete copy of the source repository.<br>
    <br>
    This command lets you recreate those hardlinks and reclaim that wasted space.<br>
    <br>
    This repository will be relinked to share space with ORIGIN, which must be on the same local disk. If ORIGIN is omitted, looks for “default-relink”, then “default”, in [paths].<br>
    <br>
    Do not attempt any read operations on this repository while the command is running. (Both repositories will be locked against writes.)
  </div>
  <div class="subsection">
    <h3>schemes</h3>
    <p>extend schemes with shortcuts to repository swarms<br>
    <br>
    This extension allows you to specify shortcuts for parent URLs with a lot of repositories to act like a scheme, for example:<br>
    <br>
    <pre> [schemes]
 py = http://code.python.org/hg/
</pre>
    <p>After that you can use it like:<br>
    <br>
    <pre> hg clone py://trunk/
</pre>
    <p>Additionally there is support for some more complex schemas, for example used by Google Code:<br>
    <br>
    <pre> [schemes]
 gcode = http://{1}.googlecode.com/hg/
</pre>
    <p>The syntax is taken from Mercurial templates, and you have unlimited number of variables, starting with <strong>{1}</strong> and continuing with <strong>{2}</strong>, <strong>{3}</strong> and so on. This variables will receive parts of URL supplied, split by <strong>/</strong>. Anything not specified as <strong>{part}</strong> will be just appended to an URL.<br>
    <br>
    For convenience, the extension adds these schemes by default:<br>
    <br>
    <pre> [schemes]
 py = http://hg.python.org/
 bb = https://bitbucket.org/
 bb+ssh = ssh://hg@bitbucket.org/
 gcode = https://{1}.googlecode.com/hg/
 kiln = https://{1}.kilnhg.com/Repo/
</pre>
    <p>You can override a predefined scheme by defining a new scheme with the same name.

    <h3>share</h3>
    <p>share a common history between several working directories
  </div>
  <div class="subsection">
    <h3>Automatic Pooled Storage for Clones</h3>
    <p>When this extension is active, <strong>hg clone</strong> can be configured to automatically share/pool storage across multiple clones. This mode effectively converts <strong>hg clone</strong> to <strong>hg clone</strong> + <strong>hg share</strong>. The benefit of using this mode is the automatic management of store paths and intelligent pooling of related repositories.<br>
    <br>
    The following <strong>share.</strong> config options influence this feature:
    <dl>
      <dt><strong>share.pool</strong>
      <dd>
        <p>Filesystem path where shared repository data will be stored. When defined, <strong>hg clone</strong> will automatically use shared repository storage instead of creating a store inside each clone.
      <dt><strong>share.poolnaming</strong>
      <dd>
        <p>How directory names in <strong>share.pool</strong> are constructed.<br>
        <br>
        “identity” means the name is derived from the first changeset in the repository. In this mode, different remotes share storage if their root/initial changeset is identical. In this mode, the local shared repository is an aggregate of all encountered remote repositories.<br>
        <br>
        “remote” means the name is derived from the source repository's path or URL. In this mode, storage is only shared if the path or URL requested in the <strong>hg clone</strong> command matches exactly to a repository that was cloned before.<br>
        <br>
        The default naming mode is “identity.”
    </dl>
  </div>
  <div class="subsection">
    <h3>Commands</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="subsection">
    <h3>share</h3>
    <p>create a new shared repository:<br>
    <br>
    <pre> hg share [-U] [-B] SOURCE [DEST]
</pre>
    <p>Initialize a new repository and working directory that shares its history (and optionally bookmarks) with another repository.
    <dl>
      <dt>Note
      <dd>
        <p>using rollback or extensions that destroy/modify history (mq, rebase, etc.) can cause considerable confusion with shared clones. In particular, if two shared clones are both updated to the same changeset, and one of them destroys that changeset with rollback, the other clone will suddenly stop working: all operations will fail with “abort: working directory has unknown parent”. The only known workaround is to use debugsetparents on the broken clone to reset it to a changeset that still exists.<br>
        <br>
        Options:
      <dt><strong>-U, --noupdate</strong>

  <div class="subsection">
    <h3>shelve</h3>
    <p>save and restore changes to the working directory<br>
    <br>
    The “hg shelve” command saves changes made to the working directory and reverts those changes, resetting the working directory to a clean state.<br>
    <br>
    Later on, the “hg unshelve” command restores the changes saved by “hg shelve”. Changes can be restored even after updating to a different parent, in which case Mercurial's merge machinery will resolve any conflicts if necessary.<br>
    <br>
    You can have more than one shelved change outstanding at a time; each shelved change has a distinct name. For details, see the help for “hg shelve”.
  </div>
  <div class="subsection">
    <h3>Commands</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="subsection">
    <h3>shelve</h3>
    <p>save and set aside changes from the working directory:<br>
    <br>
    <pre> hg shelve [OPTION]... [FILE]...
</pre>
    <p>Shelving takes files that “hg status” reports as not clean, saves the modifications to a bundle (a shelved change), and reverts the files so that their state in the working directory becomes clean.<br>
    <br>
    To restore these changes to the working directory, using “hg unshelve”; this will work even if you switch to a different commit.<br>
    <br>
    When no files are specified, “hg shelve” saves all not-clean files. If specific files or directories are named, only changes to those files are shelved.<br>
    <br>
    In bare shelve(when no files are specified, without interactive, include and exclude option), shelving remembers information if the working directory was on newly created branch, in other words working directory was on different branch than its first parent. In this situation unshelving restores branch information to the working directory.<br>
    <br>
    Each shelved change has a name that makes it easier to find later. The name of a shelved change defaults to being based on the active bookmark, or if there is no active bookmark, the current named branch. To specify a different name, use <strong>--name</strong>.<br>
    <br>
    To see a list of existing shelved changes, use the <strong>--list</strong> option. For each shelved change, this will print its name, age, and description; use <strong>--patch</strong> or <strong>--stat</strong> for more details.<br>
    <br>
    To delete specific shelved changes, use <strong>--delete</strong>. To delete all shelved changes, use <strong>--cleanup</strong>.<br>

    <h3>unshelve</h3>
    <p>restore a shelved change to the working directory:<br>
    <br>
    <pre> hg unshelve [SHELVED]
</pre>
    <p>This command accepts an optional name of a shelved change to restore. If none is given, the most recent shelved change is used.<br>
    <br>
    If a shelved change is applied successfully, the bundle that contains the shelved changes is moved to a backup location (.hg/shelve-backup).<br>
    <br>
    Since you can restore a shelved change on top of an arbitrary commit, it is possible that unshelving will result in a conflict between your changes and the commits you are unshelving onto. If this occurs, you must resolve the conflict, then use <strong>--continue</strong> to complete the unshelve operation. (The bundle will not be moved until you successfully complete the unshelve.)<br>
    <br>
    (Alternatively, you can use <strong>--abort</strong> to abandon an unshelve that causes a conflict. This reverts the unshelved changes, and leaves the bundle in place.)<br>
    <br>
    If bare shelved change(when no files are specified, without interactive, include and exclude option) was done on newly created branch it would restore branch information to the working directory.<br>
    <br>
    After a successful unshelve, the shelved changes are stored in a backup directory. Only the N most recent backups are kept. N defaults to 10 but can be overridden using the <strong>shelve.maxbackups</strong> configuration option.<br>
    <br>
    Timestamp in seconds is used to decide order of backups. More than <strong>maxbackups</strong> backups are kept, if same timestamp prevents from deciding exact order of them, for safety.<br>
    <br>
    Options:

    <h3>strip</h3>
    <p>strip changesets and their descendants from history<br>
    <br>
    This extension allows you to strip changesets and all their descendants from the repository. See the command help for details.
  </div>
  <div class="subsection">
    <h3>Commands</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="subsection">
    <h3>strip</h3>
    <p>strip changesets and all their descendants from the repository:<br>
    <br>
    <pre> hg strip [-k] [-f] [-B bookmark] [-r] REV...
</pre>
    <p>The strip command removes the specified changesets and all their descendants. If the working directory has uncommitted changes, the operation is aborted unless the --force flag is supplied, in which case changes will be discarded.<br>
    <br>
    If a parent of the working directory is stripped, then the working directory will automatically be updated to the most recent available ancestor of the stripped parent after the operation completes.<br>
    <br>
    Any stripped changesets are stored in <strong>.hg/strip-backup</strong> as a bundle (see <strong>hg help bundle</strong> and <strong>hg help unbundle</strong>). They can be restored by running <strong>hg unbundle .hg/strip-backup/BUNDLE</strong>, where BUNDLE is the bundle file created by the strip. Note that the local revision numbers will in general be different after the restore.<br>
    <br>
    Use the --no-backup option to discard the backup bundle once the operation completes.<br>
    <br>
    Strip is not a history-rewriting operation and can be used on changesets in the public phase. But if the stripped changesets have been pushed to a remote repository you will likely pull them again.<br>
    <br>
    Return 0 on success.<br>

    <h3>transplant</h3>
    <p>command to transplant changesets from another branch<br>
    <br>
    This extension allows you to transplant changes to another parent revision, possibly in another repository. The transplant is done using 'diff' patches.<br>
    <br>
    Transplanted patches are recorded in .hg/transplant/transplants, as a map from a changeset hash to its hash in the source repository.
  </div>
  <div class="subsection">
    <h3>Commands</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="subsection">
    <h3>transplant</h3>
    <p>transplant changesets from another branch:<br>
    <br>
    <pre> hg transplant [-s REPO] [-b BRANCH [-a]] [-p REV] [-m REV] [REV]...
</pre>
    <p>Selected changesets will be applied on top of the current working directory with the log of the original changeset. The changesets are copied and will thus appear twice in the history with different identities.<br>
    <br>
    Consider using the graft command if everything is inside the same repository - it will use merges and will usually give a better result. Use the rebase extension if the changesets are unpublished and you want to move them instead of copying them.<br>
    <br>
    If --log is specified, log messages will have a comment appended of the form:<br>
    <br>
    <pre> (transplanted from CHANGESETHASH)
</pre>
    <p>You can rewrite the changelog message with the --filter option. Its argument will be invoked with the current changelog message as $1 and the patch as $2.<br>
    <br>
    --source/-s specifies another repository to use for selecting changesets, just as if it temporarily had been pulled. If --branch/-b is specified, these revisions will be used as heads when deciding which changesets to transplant, just as if only these revisions had been pulled. If --all/-a is specified, all the revisions up to the heads specified with --branch will be transplanted.<br>
    <br>
    Example:
    <dl class="indent-2">
      <dt>·
      <dd>
        <p>transplant all changes up to REV on top of your current revision:<br>
        <br>
        <pre> hg transplant --branch REV --all
</pre>
        <p>You can optionally mark selected transplanted changesets as merge changesets. You will not be prompted to transplant any ancestors of a merged transplant, and you can merge descendants of them normally instead of transplanting them.<br>
        <br>
        Merge changesets may be transplanted directly by specifying the proper parent changeset by calling <strong>hg transplant --parent</strong>.<br>
        <br>
        If no merges or revisions are provided, <strong>hg transplant</strong> will start an interactive changeset browser.<br>
        <br>
        If a changeset application fails, you can fix the merge by hand and then resume where you left off by calling <strong>hg transplant --continue/-c</strong>.<br>
        <br>
        Options:
      <dt><strong>-s,</strong><em>--source</em><strong>&nbsp;&lt;REPO&gt;</strong>
      <dd>
        <p>transplant changesets from REPO
      <dt><strong>-b,</strong><em>--branch</em><strong>&nbsp;&lt;REV[+]&gt;</strong>

        <p>use this source changeset as head

    <h3>win32mbcs</h3>
    <p>allow the use of MBCS paths with problematic encodings<br>
    <br>
    Some MBCS encodings are not good for some path operations (i.e. splitting path, case conversion, etc.) with its encoded bytes. We call such a encoding (i.e. shift_jis and big5) as “problematic encoding”. This extension can be used to fix the issue with those encodings by wrapping some functions to convert to Unicode string before path operation.<br>
    <br>
    This extension is useful for:
    <dl class="indent-2">
      <dt>·
      <dd>
        <p>Japanese Windows users using shift_jis encoding.
      <dt>·
      <dd>
        <p>Chinese Windows users using big5 encoding.
      <dt>·
      <dd>
        <p>All users who use a repository with one of problematic encodings on case-insensitive file system.<br>
        <br>
        This extension is not needed for:
      <dt>·
      <dd>
        <p>Any user who use only ASCII chars in path.
      <dt>·
      <dd>
        <p>Any user who do not use any of problematic encodings.<br>
        <br>
        Note that there are some limitations on using this extension:
      <dt>·
      <dd>
        <p>You should use single encoding in one repository.
      <dt>·
      <dd>
        <p>If the repository path ends with 0x5c, .hg/hgrc cannot be read.
      <dt>·
      <dd>
        <p>win32mbcs is not compatible with fixutf8 extension.<br>
        <br>
        By default, win32mbcs uses encoding.encoding decided by Mercurial. You can specify the encoding by config option:<br>
        <br>
        <pre> [win32mbcs]
 encoding = sjis
</pre>
        <p>It is useful for the users who want to commit with UTF-8 log message.

  <div class="subsection">
    <h3>win32text</h3>
    <p>perform automatic newline conversion (DEPRECATED)<br>
    <br>
    Deprecation: The win32text extension requires each user to configure the extension again and again for each clone since the configuration is not copied when cloning.<br>
    <br>
    We have therefore made the <strong>eol</strong> as an alternative. The <strong>eol</strong> uses a version controlled file for its configuration and each clone will therefore use the right settings from the start.<br>
    <br>
    To perform automatic newline conversion, use:<br>
    <br>
    <pre> [extensions]
 win32text =
 [encode]
 ** = cleverencode:
 # or ** = macencode:

 [decode]
 ** = cleverdecode:
 # or ** = macdecode:

 pretxncommit.crlf = python:hgext.win32text.forbidcrlf
 # or pretxncommit.cr = python:hgext.win32text.forbidcr
