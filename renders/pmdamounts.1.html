  <h2>NAME</h2>
  <p><strong>pmdamounts</strong> - filesystem mounts performance metrics domain agent (PMDA)
</div>
<div class="section">
  <h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>
  <p><strong>$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/mounts/pmdamounts</strong> [<strong>-d</strong> <em>domain</em>] [<strong>-l</strong> <em>logfile</em>] [<strong>-U</strong> <em>username</em>]
</div>

  <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
  <p><strong>pmdamounts</strong> is a simple Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which monitors availability of a given set of filesystem mounts.
  <p>The <strong>mounts</strong> PMDA exports metrics that reflect whether the configured filesystems are mounted ("up") or not. The list of mount points to monitor is specified via the <em>$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/mounts/mounts.conf</em> file which simply contains one line for each mount point.
  <p>Note that the platform kernel PMDA exports a more extensive set of filesystem metrics for every mounted filesystem - this PMDA is primarily intended for availability monitoring using the <em>mounts.up</em> metric.
  <p>A brief description of the <strong>pmdamounts</strong> command line options follows:
  <dl class="indent-5">
    <dt><strong>-d</strong>
    <dd>It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics <em>domain</em> number specified here is unique and consistent. That is, <em>domain</em> should be different for every PMDA on the one host, and the same <em>domain</em> number should be used for the same PMDA on all hosts.
    <dt><strong>-l</strong>
    <dd>Location of the log file. By default, a log file named <em>mounts.log</em> is written in the current directory of <strong>pmcd</strong>(1) when <strong>pmdamounts</strong> is started, i.e. <strong>$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd</strong>. If the log file cannot be created or is not writable, output is written to the standard error instead.
    <dt><strong>-U</strong>
    <dd>User account under which to run the agent. The default is the unprivileged "pcp" account in current versions of PCP, but in older versions the superuser account ("root") was used by default.
  </dl>

  <h2>INSTALLATION</h2>
  <p>If you want access to the names, help text and values for the mounts performance metrics, do the following as root:
  <pre># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/mounts
# ./Install</pre>
  <p>If you want to undo the installation, do the following as root:
  <pre># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/mounts
# ./Remove</pre>
  <p><strong>pmdamounts</strong> is launched by <strong>pmcd</strong>(1) and should never be executed directly. The Install and Remove scripts notify <strong>pmcd</strong>(1) when the agent is installed or removed.

  <h2>PCP ENVIRONMENT</h2>
  <p>Environment variables with the prefix <strong>PCP_</strong> are used to parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP. On each installation, the file <em>/etc/pcp.conf</em> contains the local values for these variables. The <strong>$PCP_CONF</strong> variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration file, as described in <strong>pcp.conf</strong>(5).
