  <h2>NAME</h2>
  <p><strong>pmpost</strong> - append messages to the Performance Co-Pilot notice board
</section>
<section>
  <h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>
  <p><strong>$PCP_BINADM_DIR/pmpost</strong> <em>message</em>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
  <p><strong>pmpost</strong> will append the text <em>message</em> to the end of the Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) notice board file (<strong>$PCP_LOG_DIR/NOTICES</strong>) in an atomic manner that guards against corruption of the notice board file by concurrent invocations of <strong>pmpost</strong>.
  <p>The PCP notice board is intended to be a persistent store and clearing house for important messages relating to the operation of the PCP and the notification of performance alerts from <strong>pmie</strong>(1) when other notification options are either unavailable or unsuitable.
  <p>Before being written, messages are prefixed by the current time, and when the current day is different to the last time the notice board file was written, <strong>pmpost</strong> will prepend the message with the full date.
  <p>If the notice board file does not exist, <strong>pmpost</strong> will create it. <strong>pmpost</strong> would usually run from long-running PCP daemons executing under the (typically unprivileged) <strong>$PCP_USER</strong> and <strong>$PCP_GROUP</strong> accounts. The file should be owned by root, and group writable by the <strong>$PCP_GROUP</strong> group.
