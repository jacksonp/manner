  <h2>NAME</h2>
  <p>lc - Mono License Compiler

  <h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>
  <p><strong>lc -c filename -t targetassembly [-i reference...] [-v] [-o outputpath] [-nologo]</strong>

  <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
  <p><em>lc</em> tool is a license compiler for Mono. It's used to convert a &nbsp;licenses.licx file to a resource that can be embedded into an executable.
  <p>When using commercial components for .NET they often require a license resource at runtime to make sure the developer was licensed to use this &nbsp;control. The most common way of making sure the component was properly licensed is by using license resources. At compile time the developer uses the <em>lc</em> tool to convert a licenses.licx file to a &nbsp;programname.exe.licenses file and embed that as a managed resource during compilation.

  <h2>RUNTIME OPTIONS</h2>
  <p>The following options are available:
  <dl>
    <dt><strong>--complist=filename</strong>, <strong>-c filename</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>This option is used to specify the input file, the licenses.licx file to create a license reesource for. This option is required. The license &nbsp;compiler will read each line in this file and try to load the types specified on that line.
    <dt><strong>--target=assemblyname</strong>, <strong>-t targetassembly</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>full assembly name with file extension for the target assembly. The license compiler uses this as a key when compiling the licenses. It has to match the assembly the resource will be embedded in. This option is required.
    <dt><strong>--load=reference</strong>, <strong>-i reference</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Assembly reference to load before trying to compile a license. This option is needed for assemblies where the references are not in the &nbsp;gac. Compilers should pass all references to the license compiler.
    <dt><strong>--verbose,</strong>, <strong>-v</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Gives more verbose output about the license compiling process.
    <dt><strong>--help</strong>, <strong>-h</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Displays usage instructions.
    <dt><strong>--outdir=path</strong>, <strong>-o path</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Target path file the licenses resource. By default the license compiler emits the resource in the current directory. The filename will always match the target assembly passed to --target with .licenses &nbsp;added.
    <dt><strong>--nologo</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Do not emit the "Mono License Compiler" logo &nbsp;on stdout while compilng.
  </dl>

  <h2>LICENSE FILES</h2>
  <p>The format for the license files (licenses.licx) is the following:
  <pre>      # comment
        namespace.type, assemblyname
        namespace.type, full-assemblyname</pre>
  <p>All lines starting with a # are ignored. the first form requires that the assembly was loaded through the --load,-i option but does not require the full assembly name, only the first part.
  <p>The second form requires the full assembly name including locale, version and publickeytoken.
