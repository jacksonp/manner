<h1>LSCPU</h1>
<section>
  <h2>NAME</h2>
  <p>lscpu - display information about the CPU architecture
</section>
<section>
  <h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>
  <p><strong>lscpu</strong> [<strong>-a</strong>|<strong>-b</strong>|<strong>-c</strong>] [<strong>-x</strong>] [<strong>-y</strong>] [<strong>-s</strong> <em>directory</em>] [<strong>-e</strong>[=<em>list</em>]|<strong>-p</strong>[=<em>list</em>]]<br>
  <strong>lscpu</strong> <strong>-h</strong>|<strong>-V</strong>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
  <p><strong>lscpu</strong> gathers CPU architecture information from sysfs, /proc/cpuinfo and any applicable architecture-specific libraries (e.g. librtas on Powerpc). &nbsp;The command output can be optimized for parsing or for easy readability by humans. The information includes, for example, the number of CPUs, threads, cores, sockets, and Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) nodes. &nbsp;There is also information about the CPU caches and cache sharing, family, model, bogoMIPS, byte order, and stepping.
  <p>In virtualized environments, the CPU architecture information displayed reflects the configuration of the guest operating system which is typically different from the physical (host) system. &nbsp;On architectures that support retrieving physical topology information, <strong>lscpu</strong> also displays the number of physical sockets, chips, cores in the host system.
  <p>Options that result in an output table have a <em>list</em> argument. &nbsp;Use this argument to customize the command output. &nbsp;Specify a comma-separated list of column labels to limit the output table to only the specified columns, arranged in the specified order. &nbsp;See <strong>COLUMNS</strong> for a list of valid column labels. &nbsp;The column labels are not case sensitive.
  <p>Not all columns are supported on all architectures. &nbsp;If an unsupported column is specified, <strong>lscpu</strong> prints the column but does not provide any data for it.
  <section>
    <h3>COLUMNS</h3>
    <p>Note that topology elements (core, socket, etc.) use a sequential unique ID starting from zero, but CPU logical numbers follow the kernel where there is no guarantee of sequential numbering.
    <dl>
      <dt><strong>CPU</strong>
      <dd>
        <p>The logical CPU number of a CPU as used by the Linux kernel.
      <dt><strong>CORE</strong>
      <dd>
        <p>The logical core number. &nbsp;A core can contain several CPUs.
      <dt><strong>SOCKET</strong>
      <dd>
        <p>The logical socket number. &nbsp;A socket can contain several cores.
      <dt><strong>BOOK</strong>
      <dd>
        <p>The logical book number. &nbsp;A book can contain several sockets.
      <dt><strong>DRAWER</strong>
      <dd>
        <p>The logical drawer number. &nbsp;A drawer can contain several books.
      <dt><strong>NODE</strong>
      <dd>
        <p>The logical NUMA node number. &nbsp;A node can contain several drawers.
      <dt><strong>CACHE</strong>
      <dd>
        <p>Information about how caches are shared between CPUs.
      <dt><strong>ADDRESS</strong>
      <dd>
        <p>The physical address of a CPU.
      <dt><strong>ONLINE</strong>
      <dd>
        <p>Indicator that shows whether the Linux instance currently makes use of the CPU.
      <dt><strong>CONFIGURED</strong>
      <dd>
        <p>Indicator that shows if the hypervisor has allocated the CPU to the virtual hardware on which the Linux instance runs. &nbsp;CPUs that are configured can be set online by the Linux instance. This column contains data only if your hardware system and hypervisor support dynamic CPU resource allocation.
      <dt><strong>POLARIZATION</strong>
      <dd>
        <p>This column contains data for Linux instances that run on virtual hardware with a hypervisor that can switch the CPU dispatching mode (polarization). &nbsp;The polarization can be:
        <dl class="indent-12">
          <dt><strong>horizontal</strong>
          <dd>
            <p>The workload is spread across all available CPUs.
          <dt><strong>vertical</strong>
          <dd>
            <p>The workload is concentrated on few CPUs.
        </dl>
        <p>For vertical polarization, the column also shows the degree of concentration, high, medium, or low. &nbsp;This column contains data only if your hardware system and hypervisor support CPU polarization.
      <dt><strong>MAXMHZ</strong>
      <dd>
        <p>Maximum megahertz value for the CPU. Useful when <strong>lscpu</strong> is used as hardware inventory information gathering tool. &nbsp;Notice that the megahertz value is dynamic, and driven by CPU governor depending on current resource need.
      <dt><strong>MINMHZ</strong>
      <dd>
        <p>Minimum megahertz value for the CPU.
    </dl>

  <h2>OPTIONS</h2>
  <dl>
    <dt><strong>-a</strong>, <strong>--all</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Include lines for online and offline CPUs in the output (default for <strong>-e</strong>). This option may only be specified together with option <strong>-e</strong> or <strong>-p</strong>.
    <dt><strong>-b</strong>, <strong>--online</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Limit the output to online CPUs (default for <strong>-p</strong>). This option may only be specified together with option <strong>-e</strong> or <strong>-p</strong>.
    <dt><strong>-c</strong>, <strong>--offline</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Limit the output to offline CPUs. This option may only be specified together with option <strong>-e</strong> or <strong>-p</strong>.
    <dt><strong>-e</strong>, <strong>--extended</strong>[=<em>list</em>]
    <dd>
      <p>Display the CPU information in human-readable format.
      <p>If the <em>list</em> argument is omitted, all columns for which data is available are included in the command output.
      <p>When specifying the <em>list</em> argument, the string of option, equal sign (=), and <em>list</em> must not contain any blanks or other whitespace. Examples: '<strong>-e=cpu,node</strong>' or '<strong>--extended=cpu,node</strong>'.
    <dt><strong>-h</strong>, <strong>--help</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Display help text and exit.
    <dt><strong>-p</strong>, <strong>--parse</strong>[=<em>list</em>]
    <dd>
      <p>Optimize the command output for easy parsing.
      <p>If the <em>list</em> argument is omitted, the command output is compatible with earlier versions of <strong>lscpu</strong>. &nbsp;In this compatible format, two commas are used to separate CPU cache columns. &nbsp;If no CPU caches are identified the cache column is omitted.<br>
      If the <em>list</em> argument is used, cache columns are separated with a colon (:).
      <p>When specifying the <em>list</em> argument, the string of option, equal sign (=), and <em>list</em> must not contain any blanks or other whitespace. Examples: '<strong>-p=cpu,node</strong>' or '<strong>--parse=cpu,node</strong>'.
    <dt><strong>-s</strong>, <strong>--sysroot</strong> <em>directory</em>
    <dd>
      <p>Gather CPU data for a Linux instance other than the instance from which the <strong>lscpu</strong> command is issued. &nbsp;The specified <em>directory</em> is the system root of the Linux instance to be inspected.
    <dt><strong>-x</strong>, <strong>--hex</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Use hexadecimal masks for CPU sets (for example 0x3). &nbsp;The default is to print the sets in list format (for example 0,1).
    <dt><strong>-y</strong>, <strong>--physical</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Display physical IDs for all columns with topology elements (core, socket, etc.). Other than logical IDs, which are assigned by <strong>lscpu</strong>, physical IDs are platform-specific values that are provided by the kernel. Physical IDs are not necessarily unique and they might not be arranged sequentially. If the kernel could not retrieve a physical ID for an element <strong>lscpu</strong> prints the dash (-) character.
      <p>The CPU logical numbers are not affected by this option.
    <dt><strong>-V</strong>, <strong>--version</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>Display version information and exit.
  </dl>

  <h2>BUGS</h2>
  <p>The basic overview of CPU family, model, etc. is always based on the first CPU only.
  <p>Sometimes in Xen Dom0 the kernel reports wrong data.
  <p>On virtual hardware the number of cores per socket, etc. can be wrong.
