  <h2>NAME</h2>
  <p>dpkg-genchanges - generate Debian .changes files
</div>
<div class="section">
  <h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>
  <p><strong>dpkg-genchanges</strong> [<em>option</em>...]<br>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
  <p><strong>dpkg-genchanges</strong> reads information from an unpacked and built Debian source tree and from the files it has generated and generates a Debian upload control file (<strong>.changes</strong> file).
</div>
<div class="section">
  <h2>OPTIONS</h2>
  <dl>
    <dt><strong>-g</strong>
    <dd>Specifies that only source and architecture independent packages should be uploaded, thus no architecture specific packages will be included (since dpkg 1.17.11).
    <dt><strong>-G</strong>
    <dd>Specifies that only source and architecture specific packages should be uploaded, thus no architecture independent packages will be included (since dpkg 1.17.11).
    <dt><strong>-b</strong>, <strong>-B</strong>, <strong>-A</strong>
    <dd>Specifies that a binary-only build is taking place, thus no source files are to be included. There's no distinction between <strong>-b</strong>, <strong>-B</strong> and <strong>-A</strong>, the produced <strong>.changes</strong> file will include whatever files were created by the <strong>binary-*</strong> target(s) of the package being built.
    <dt><strong>-S</strong>
    <dd>Specifies that only the source should be uploaded, thus no binary packages will be included.
  </dl>
  <p>The <strong>-s</strong><em>x</em> options control whether the original source archive is included in the upload if any source is being generated (i.e. <strong>-b</strong> or <strong>-B</strong> haven't been used).
  <dl>
    <dt><strong>-si</strong>
    <dd>By default, or if specified, the original source will be included only if the upstream version number (the version without epoch and without Debian revision) differs from the upstream version number of the previous changelog entry.
    <dt><strong>-sa</strong>
    <dd>Forces the inclusion of the original source.
    <dt><strong>-sd</strong>
    <dd>Forces the exclusion of the original source and includes only the diff.
    <dt><strong>-v</strong><em>version</em>
    <dd>Causes changelog information from all versions strictly later than <em>version</em> to be used.
    <dt><strong>-C</strong><em>changes-description</em>
    <dd>Read the description of the changes from the file <em>changes-description</em> rather than using the information from the source tree's changelog file.
    <dt><strong>-m</strong><em>maintainer-address</em>
    <dd>Use <em>maintainer-address</em> as the name and email address of the maintainer for this package, rather than using the information from the source tree's control file.
    <dt><strong>-e</strong><em>maintainer-address</em>
    <dd>Use <em>maintainer-address</em> as the name and email address of the maintainer for this upload, rather than using the information from the source tree's changelog.
    <dt><strong>-V</strong><em>name</em><strong>=</strong><em>value</em>
    <dd>Set an output substitution variable. See <strong>deb-substvars</strong>(5) for a discussion of output substitution.
    <dt><strong>-T</strong><em>substvars-file</em>
    <dd>Read substitution variables in <em>substvars-file</em>; the default is <strong>debian/substvars</strong>. No variable substitution is done on any of the fields that are output, however the special variable <em>Format</em> will override the field of the same name. This option can be used multiple times to read substitution variables from multiple files (since dpkg 1.15.6).
    <dt><strong>-D</strong><em>field</em><strong>=</strong><em>value</em>
    <dd>Override or add an output control file field.
    <dt><strong>-U</strong><em>field</em>
    <dd>Remove an output control file field.
    <dt><strong>-c</strong><em>controlfile</em>
    <dd>Specifies the main source control file to read information from. The default is <strong>debian/control</strong>.
    <dt><strong>-l</strong><em>changelog-file</em>
    <dd>Specifies the changelog file to read information from. The default is <strong>debian/changelog</strong>.
    <dt><strong>-f</strong><em>files-list-file</em>
    <dd>Read the list of files to be uploaded here, rather than using <strong>debian/files</strong>.
    <dt><strong>-F</strong><em>changelog-format</em>
    <dd>Specifies the format of the changelog. See <strong>dpkg-parsechangelog</strong>(1) for information about alternative formats.
    <dt><strong>-u</strong><em>upload-files-dir</em>
    <dd>Look for the files to be uploaded in <em>upload-files-dir</em> rather than <strong>..</strong> (<strong>dpkg-genchanges</strong> needs to find these files so that it can include their sizes and checksums in the <strong>.changes</strong> file).
    <dt><strong>-q</strong>
    <dd>Usually <strong>dpkg-genchanges</strong> will produce informative messages on standard error, for example about how many of the package's source files are being uploaded. <strong>-q</strong> suppresses these messages.
    <dt><strong>-?</strong>, <strong>--help</strong>
    <dd>Show the usage message and exit.
    <dt><strong>--version</strong>
    <dd>Show the version and exit.
  </dl>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <h2>FILES</h2>
  <dl>
    <dt><strong>debian/files</strong>
    <dd>The list of generated files which are part of the upload being prepared. <strong>dpkg-genchanges</strong> reads the data here when producing a <strong>.changes</strong> file.
  </dl>
