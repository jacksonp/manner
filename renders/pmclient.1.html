<h1>PMCLIENT</h1>
<section>
  <h2>NAME</h2>
  <p><strong>pmclient</strong>, <strong>pmclient_fg</strong> - a simple performance metrics client
</section>

  <h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>
  <p><strong>pmclient</strong> [<strong>-a</strong> <em>archive</em>] [<strong>-h</strong> <em>host</em>] [<strong>-n</strong> <em>pmnsfile</em>] [<strong>-P</strong>] [<strong>-S</strong> <em>numsec</em>] [<strong>-s</strong> <em>samples</em>] [<strong>-t</strong> <em>interval</em>] [<strong>-Z</strong> <em>timezone</em>] [<strong>-z</strong>]

  <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
  <p><strong>pmclient</strong> and <strong>pmclient_fg</strong> are simple clients that use the Performance Metrics Application Programming Interface (PMAPI) to report some high-level system performance metrics.
  <p>The real value of these tools &nbsp;is as sample clients using the <strong>PMAPI</strong>(3), interfaces and to this end the source code is included with the Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) package (see <strong>PCPIntro</strong>(1)), and is typically installed in <em>/usr/share/pcp/demos/pmclient</em>.
  <p>The <strong>pmclient_fg</strong> program differs to <strong>pmclient</strong> in that it uses the fetchgroup API extension to the PMAPI, see <strong>pmFetchGroup</strong>(3).
  <p>Normally <strong>pmclient</strong> operates on the distributed Performance Metrics Name Space (PMNS), however if the <strong>-n</strong> option is specified an alternative local PMNS is loaded from the file <em>pmnsfile</em>.
  <p>Unless directed to another host by the <strong>-h</strong> option, or to an archive by the <strong>-a</strong> option, <strong>pmclient</strong> will contact the Performance Metrics Collector Daemon (PMCD) on the local host to obtain the required information. The argument to <strong>-a</strong> is a comma-separated list of names, each of which may be the base name of an archive or the name of a directory containing one or more archives. The <strong>-a</strong> and <strong>-h</strong> options are mutually exclusive.
  <p>By default, <strong>pmclient</strong> reports the time of day according to the local timezone on the system where <strong>pmclient</strong> is run. The <strong>-Z</strong> option changes the timezone to <em>timezone</em> in the format of the environment variable <strong>TZ</strong> as described in <strong>environ</strong>(7). The <strong>-z</strong> option changes the timezone to the local timezone at the host that is the source of the performance metrics, as identified via either the <strong>-h</strong> or <strong>-a</strong> options.
  <p>Other options control the specific information to be reported.
  <dl>
    <dt><strong>-P</strong>
    <dd>
      <p>The default behavior for replaying a set of archives, is to replay at full speed. &nbsp;The <strong>-P</strong> option may be used in conjunction with a set of archives, to request that the prevailing real-time delay be applied between samples (see <strong>-t</strong>) to effect a pause.
    <dt><strong>-S</strong> <em>numsec</em>
    <dd>
      <p>The <strong>-S</strong> option may be used in conjunction with a set of archives to request that display start at the time <em>numsec</em> seconds from the start of the set of archives.
    <dt><strong>-s</strong> <em>samples</em>
    <dd>
      <p>The argument <em>samples</em> defines the number of samples to be retrieved and reported. If samples is 0 or <strong>-s</strong> is not specified, <strong>pmclient</strong> will sample and report continuously (in real time mode) or until the end of the set of PCP archives (in archive mode).
    <dt><strong>-t</strong> <em>interval</em>
    <dd>
      <p>The default update <em>interval</em> may be set to something other than the default 5 seconds. The <em>interval</em> argument follows the syntax described in <strong>PCPIntro</strong>(1), and in the simplest form may be an unsigned integer (the implied units in this case are seconds).
  </dl>
  <p>The output from <strong>pmclient</strong> is directed to standard output, and lists
  <ul class="indent-3">
    <li>Aggregate CPU utilization, in the range 0 to 1.
    <li>If the system has more than 1 CPU, the ordinal number of the busiest CPU, in the range 0 to ...
    <li>If the system has more than 1 CPU, the CPU utilization for the busiest CPU.
    <li>Real free memory in Mbytes.
    <li>Aggregate physical disk I/O operations per second (IOPS).
    <li>Load average over the last 1 minute and over the last 15 minutes.
  </ul>

  <h2>PCP ENVIRONMENT</h2>
  <p>Environment variables with the prefix <strong>PCP_</strong> are used to parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP. On each installation, the file <em>/etc/pcp.conf</em> contains the local values for these variables. The <strong>$PCP_CONF</strong> variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration file, as described in <strong>pcp.conf</strong>(5).
