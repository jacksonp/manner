<h1>TELNET-PROBE</h1>
<section>
  <h2>NAME</h2>
  <p><strong>telnet-probe</strong> - lightweight telnet-like port probe
</section>
<section>
  <h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>
  <p><strong>$PCP_BINADM_DIR/telnet-probe</strong> [<strong>-c</strong>] [<strong>-v</strong>] <em>host</em> <em>port</em>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
  <p><strong>telnet-probe</strong> allows the <strong>pmdashping</strong>(1) daemons to establish connections to arbitrary local and remote service-providing daemons so that response time and service availability information can be obtained.
  <p>The required <em>host</em> and <em>port</em> number arguments have the same meaning as their <strong>telnet</strong>(1) equivalents.
  <p>The <strong>-c</strong> option causes <strong>telnet-probe</strong> to perform a <strong>connect</strong>(2) only. This skips the <strong>read</strong>(2) and <strong>write</strong>(2) exercise that would otherwise be done after connecting (see below).
  <p>The <strong>-v</strong> option causes <strong>telnet-probe</strong> to be verbose while operating.
  <p>Once the telnet connection has been established, <strong>telnet-probe</strong> reads from <em>stdin</em> until end-of-file, and writes all the input data to the telnet connection. Next, <strong>telnet-probe</strong> will read from the telnet connection until end-of-file, discarding whatever data it receives. Then <strong>telnet-probe</strong> exits.
  <p>To operate successfully, the input passed via <strong>telnet-probe</strong> to the remote service must be sufficient to cause the remote service to close the connection when the last line of input has been processed, e.g. ending with ``quit'' when probing SMTP on port 25.
  <p>By default <strong>telnet-probe</strong> will not produce any output, unless there is an error in which case a diagnostic message can be displayed (in verbose mode only) and the exit status will be non-zero indicating a failure.

  <h2>PCP ENVIRONMENT</h2>
  <p>Environment variables with the prefix <strong>PCP_</strong> are used to parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP. On each installation, the file <em>/etc/pcp.conf</em> contains the local values for these variables. The <strong>$PCP_CONF</strong> variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration file, as described in <strong>pcp.conf</strong>(5).

  <h2>DIAGNOSTICS</h2>
  <p>If <strong>telnet-probe</strong> succeeds, then 0 will be returned. If the attempt to establish a connection fails or is terminated, then a non-zero exit status is returned.
