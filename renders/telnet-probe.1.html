<h1>TELNET-PROBE</h1>
<div class="section">
  <h2>NAME</h2>
  <p><strong>telnet-probe</strong> - lightweight telnet-like port probe
</div>
<div class="section">
  <h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>
  <p><strong>$PCP_BINADM_DIR/telnet-probe</strong> [<strong>-c</strong>] [<strong>-v</strong>] <em>host</em> <em>port</em>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
  <p><strong>telnet-probe</strong> allows the <strong>pmdashping</strong>(1) daemons to establish connections to arbitrary local and remote service-providing daemons so that response time and service availability information can be obtained.
  <p>The required <em>host</em> and <em>port</em> number arguments have the same meaning as their <strong>telnet</strong>(1) equivalents.
  <p>The <strong>-c</strong> option causes <strong>telnet-probe</strong> to perform a <strong>connect</strong>(2) only. This skips the <strong>read</strong>(2) and <strong>write</strong>(2) exercise that would otherwise be done after connecting (see below).
  <p>The <strong>-v</strong> option causes <strong>telnet-probe</strong> to be verbose while operating.
  <p>Once the telnet connection has been established, <strong>telnet-probe</strong> reads from <em>stdin</em> until end-of-file, and writes all the input data to the telnet connection. Next, <strong>telnet-probe</strong> will read from the telnet connection until end-of-file, discarding whatever data it receives. Then <strong>telnet-probe</strong> exits.
  <p>To operate successfully, the input passed via <strong>telnet-probe</strong> to the remote service must be sufficient to cause the remote service to close the connection when the last line of input has been processed, e.g. ending with “quit” when probing SMTP on port 25.
  <p>By default <strong>telnet-probe</strong> will not produce any output, unless there is an error in which case a diagnostic message can be displayed (in verbose mode only) and the exit status will be non-zero indicating a failure.

  <h2>PCP ENVIRONMENT</h2>
  <p>Environment variables with the prefix <strong>PCP_</strong> are used to parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP. On each installation, the file <em>/etc/pcp.conf</em> contains the local values for these variables. The <strong>$PCP_CONF</strong> variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration file, as described in <strong>pcp.conf</strong>(5).

  <h2>DIAGNOSTICS</h2>
  <p>If <strong>telnet-probe</strong> succeeds, then 0 will be returned. If the attempt to establish a connection fails or is terminated, then a non-zero exit status is returned.
