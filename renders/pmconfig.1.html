  <h2>NAME</h2>
  <p><strong>pmconfig</strong> - Performance Co-Pilot configuration parameters
</section>
<section>
  <h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>
  <p><strong>$PCP_BINADM_DIR/pmconfig</strong> [<strong>-a</strong>|<strong>-l</strong>] [<strong>-L</strong>] [<strong>-s</strong>] [<em>name ...</em>]
</section>
<section>
  <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
  <p><strong>pmconfig</strong> displays the values for some or all configuration parameters &nbsp;of the local Performance Co-Pilot toolkit installation.
  <p>The <strong>-L</strong> option may be used to change the default reporting mode so that the capabilities of the PCP library are reported, rather than the PCP environment.
  <p>An output format suitable for sourcing in shell scripts can be obtained using the <strong>-s</strong> option, which ensures configuration information is quoted and preceded by an export statement. When not reporting the library capabilities, this mode will produce a statement that does not override an existing setting in the environment for PCP configuration variables.
  <p>In the default operating mode, <strong>pmconfig</strong> is often used in conjunction with the <strong>$PCP_DIR</strong> environment variable to setup scripts running under the Windows operating system, where the filesystem hierarchy differs greatly to the of Linux/UNIX-based operating systems.

  <h2>PCP ENVIRONMENT</h2>
  <p>Environment variables with the prefix <strong>PCP_</strong> are used to parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP. On each installation, the file <em>/etc/pcp.conf</em> contains the local values for these variables. The <strong>$PCP_CONF</strong> variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration file, as described in <strong>pcp.conf</strong>(5).
