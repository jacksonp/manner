<h1>PIDSTAT</h1>
<div class="section">
  <h2>NAME</h2>
  <p>pidstat - Report statistics for Linux tasks.
</div>
<div class="section">
  <h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>
  <p><strong>pidstat [ -d ] [ -h ] [ -I ] [ -l ] [ -R ] [ -r ] [ -s ] [ -t ] [ -U [</strong> <em>username</em> <strong>] ] [ -u ] [ -V ] [ -v ] [ -w ] [ -C</strong> <em>comm</em> <strong>] [ -G</strong> <em>process_name</em> <strong>] [ -p {</strong> <em>pid</em> <strong>[,...] | SELF | ALL } ] [ -T { TASK | CHILD | ALL } ] [</strong> <em>interval</em> <strong>[</strong> <em>count</em> <strong>] ]</strong>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
  <p>The <strong>pidstat</strong> command is used for monitoring individual tasks currently being managed by the Linux kernel. It writes to standard output activities for every task selected with option <strong>-p</strong> or for every task managed by the Linux kernel if option <strong>-p ALL</strong> has been used. Not selecting any tasks is equivalent to specifying <strong>-p ALL</strong> but only active tasks (tasks with non-zero statistics values) will appear in the report.
  <p>The <strong>pidstat</strong> command can also be used for monitoring the child processes of selected tasks. Read about option <strong>-T</strong> below.
  <p>The <em>interval</em> parameter specifies the amount of time in seconds between each report. A value of 0 (or no parameters at all) indicates that tasks statistics are to be reported for the time since system startup (boot). The <em>count</em> parameter can be specified in conjunction with the <em>interval</em> parameter if this one is not set to zero. The value of <em>count</em> determines the number of reports generated at <em>interval</em> seconds apart. If the <em>interval</em> parameter is specified without the <em>count</em> parameter, the <strong>pidstat</strong> command generates reports continuously.
  <p>You can select information about specific task activities using flags. Not specifying any flags selects only CPU activity.

  <h2>OPTIONS</h2>
  <dl>
    <dt>-C comm

      <p>Display only tasks whose command name includes the string <em>comm</em>. This string can be a regular expression.
    <dt>-d
    <dd>
      <p>Report I/O statistics (kernels 2.6.20 and later only). The following values may be displayed:
      <p><strong>UID</strong>
      <p>The real user identification number of the task being monitored.
      <p><strong>USER</strong><br>
      The name of the real user owning the task being monitored.
      <p><strong>PID</strong><br>
      The identification number of the task being monitored.
      <p><strong>kB_rd/s</strong><br>
      Number of kilobytes the task has caused to be read from disk per second.
      <p><strong>kB_wr/s</strong><br>
      Number of kilobytes the task has caused, or shall cause to be written to disk per second.
      <p><strong>kB_ccwr/s</strong><br>
      Number of kilobytes whose writing to disk has been cancelled by the task. This may occur when the task truncates some dirty pagecache. In this case, some IO which another task has been accounted for will not be happening.
      <p><strong>iodelay</strong><br>
      Block I/O delay of the task being monitored, measured in clock ticks. This metric includes the delays spent waiting for sync block I/O completion and for swapin block I/O completion.

      The command name of the task.
    <dt>-G process_name
    <dd>
      <p>Display only processes whose command name includes the string <em>process_name</em>. This string can be a regular expression.

  <h2>ENVIRONMENT</h2>
  <p>The <strong>pidstat</strong> command takes into account the following environment variables:
  <dl>
    <dt>S_COLORS
    <dd>
      <p>When this variable is set, display statistics in color on the terminal. Possible values for this variable are <em>never</em>, <em>always</em> or <em>auto</em> (the latter is the default).
      <p>Please note that the color (being red, yellow, or some other color) used to display a value is not indicative of any kind of issue simply because of the color. It only indicates different ranges of values.
    <dt>S_COLORS_SGR
    <dd>
      <p>Specify the colors and other attributes used to display statistics on the terminal. Its value is a colon-separated list of capabilities that defaults to <strong>H=31;1:I=32;22:M=34;1:N=33;1:Z=33;22</strong>. Supported capabilities are:
      <dl>
        <dt><strong>H=</strong>
        <dd>
          <p>SGR (Select Graphic Rendition) substring for percentage values greater than or equal to 75%.
        <dt><strong>I=</strong>
        <dd>
          <p>SGR substring for item values like PID, UID or CPU number.
        <dt><strong>M=</strong>
        <dd>
          <p>SGR substring for percentage values in the range from 50% to 75%.
        <dt><strong>N=</strong>
        <dd>
          <p>SGR substring for non-zero statistics values and for tasks names.
        <dt><strong>Z=</strong>
        <dd>
          <p>SGR substring for zero values and for threads names.
      </dl>
    <dt>S_TIME_FORMAT
    <dd>
      <p>If this variable exists and its value is <strong>ISO</strong> then the current locale will be ignored when printing the date in the report header. The <strong>pidstat</strong> command will use the ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD) instead. The timestamp will also be compliant with ISO 8601 format.
  </dl>

  <h2>BUGS</h2>
  <p><em>/proc</em> filesystem must be mounted for the <strong>pidstat</strong> command to work.
