  <h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>
  <p><strong>$PCP_BINADM_DIR/pmsignal</strong> [<strong>-alnp</strong>] [<strong>-s</strong> <em>signal</em>] [<em>PID</em> ...|<em>name</em> ...]

  <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
  <p><strong>pmsignal</strong> provides a cross-platform event signalling mechanism for use with tools from the Performance Co-Pilot toolkit. It can be used to send a named <em>signal</em> (only HUP, USR1, TERM, and KILL are accepted) to one or more processes.
  <p>The processes are specified directly using PIDs or as program names (with either the <strong>-a</strong>/<strong>--all</strong> or <strong>-p</strong>/<strong>--program</strong> options). In the <strong>all</strong> case, the set of all running processes is searched for a <a href="/1/basename" class="link-man">basename(1)</a> match on <em>name</em>. In the <strong>program</strong> case, process identifiers are extracted from files in the $PCP_RUN_DIR directrory where file names are matched on <em>name</em>.pid.
  <p>The <strong>-n</strong>/<strong>--dry-run</strong> option reports the list of process identifiers that would have been signalled, but no signals are actually sent.
  <p>If a <em>signal</em> is not specified, then the TERM signal will be sent. The list of supported signals is reported when using the <strong>-l</strong>/<strong>--list</strong> option.
  <p>On Linux and UNIX platforms, <em>pmsignal</em> is a simple wrapper around the <em>kill</em>(1) command. On Windows, the is no direct equivalent to this mechanism, and so an alternate mechanism has been implemented - this is only honoured by PCP tools, however, not all Windows utilities.

  <h2>PCP ENVIRONMENT</h2>
  <p>Environment variables with the prefix <strong>PCP_</strong> are used to parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP. On each installation, the file <em>/etc/pcp.conf</em> contains the local values for these variables. The <strong>$PCP_CONF</strong> variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration file, as described in <a href="/5/pcp.conf" class="link-man">pcp.conf(5)</a>.
